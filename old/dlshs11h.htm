<H3>ACT I</H3>

<P><SPAN class="stage-direction">[SCENE.--A room furnished comfortably and tastefully, but not extravagantly. At the back, a door to the right leads to the entrance-hall, another to the left leads to Helmer's study. Between the doors stands a piano. In the middle of the left-hand wall is a door, and beyond it a window. Near the window are a round table, arm-chairs and a small sofa. In the right-hand wall, at the farther end, another door; and on the same side, nearer the footlights, a stove, two easy chairs and a rocking-chair; between the stove and the door, a small table. Engravings on the walls; a cabinet with china and other small objects; a small book-case with well-bound books. The floors are carpeted, and a fire burns in the stove.</SPAN>

<P><SPAN class="stage-direction">It is winter. A bell rings in the hall; shortly afterwards the door is heard to open. Enter NORA, humming a tune and in high spirits. She is in outdoor dress and carries a number of parcels; these she lays on the table to the right. She leaves the outer door open after her, and through it is seen a PORTER who is carrying a Christmas Tree and a basket, which he gives to the MAID who has opened the door.]</SPAN>

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Hide the Christmas Tree carefully, Helen. Be sure the children do not see it until this evening, when it is dressed. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[To the PORTER, taking out her purse.]</SPAN> How much?

<P><SPAN class="character">Porter</SPAN>. Sixpence.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. There is a shilling. No, keep the change. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[The PORTER thanks her, and goes out. NORA shuts the door. She is laughing to herself, as she takes off her hat and coat. She takes a packet of macaroons from her pocket and eats one or two; then goes cautiously to her husband's door and listens.]</SPAN> Yes, he is in. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Still humming, she goes to the table on the right.]</SPAN>

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[calls out from his room]</SPAN>. Is that my little lark twittering out there?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[busy opening some of the parcels]</SPAN>. Yes, it is!

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Is it my little squirrel bustling about?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Yes!

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. When did my squirrel come home?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Just now. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Puts the bag of macaroons into her pocket and wipes her mouth.]</SPAN> Come in here, Torvald, and see what I have bought.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Don't disturb me. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[A little later, he opens the door and looks into the room, pen in hand.]</SPAN> Bought, did you say? All these things? Has my little spendthrift been wasting money again?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Yes but, Torvald, this year we really can let ourselves go a little. This is the first Christmas that we have not needed to economise.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Still, you know, we can't spend money recklessly.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Yes, Torvald, we may be a wee bit more reckless now, mayn't we? Just a tiny wee bit! You are going to have a big salary and earn lots and lots of money.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Yes, after the New Year; but then it will be a whole quarter before the salary is due.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Pooh! we can borrow until then.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Nora! <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Goes up to her and takes her playfully by the ear.]</SPAN> The same little featherhead! Suppose, now, that I borrowed fifty pounds today, and you spent it all in the Christmas week, and then on New Year's Eve a slate fell on my head and killed me, and--

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN> <SPAN class="stage-direction">[putting her hands over his mouth]</SPAN>. Oh! don't say such horrid things.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Still, suppose that happened,--what then?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. If that were to happen, I don't suppose I should care whether I owed money or not.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Yes, but what about the people who had lent it?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. They? Who would bother about them? I should not know who they were.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. That is like a woman! But seriously, Nora, you know what I think about that. No debt, no borrowing. There can be no freedom or beauty about a home life that depends on borrowing and debt. We two have kept bravely on the straight road so far, and we will go on the same way for the short time longer that there need be any struggle.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[moving towards the stove]</SPAN>. As you please, Torvald.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[following her]</SPAN>. Come, come, my little skylark must not droop her wings. What is this! Is my little squirrel out of temper? <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Taking out his purse.]</SPAN> Nora, what do you think I have got here?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[turning round quickly]</SPAN>. Money!

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. There you are. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Gives her some money.]</SPAN> Do you think I don't know what a lot is wanted for housekeeping at Christmas- time?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[counting]</SPAN>. Ten shillings--a pound--two pounds! Thank you, thank you, Torvald; that will keep me going for a long time.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Indeed it must.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Yes, yes, it will. But come here and let me show you what I have bought. And all so cheap! Look, here is a new suit for Ivar, and a sword; and a horse and a trumpet for Bob; and a doll and dolly's bedstead for Emmy,--they are very plain, but anyway she will soon break them in pieces. And here are dress-lengths and handkerchiefs for the maids; old Anne ought really to have something better.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. And what is in this parcel?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[crying out]</SPAN>. No, no! you mustn't see that until this evening.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Very well. But now tell me, you extravagant little person, what would you like for yourself?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. For myself? Oh, I am sure I don't want anything.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Yes, but you must. Tell me something reasonable that you would particularly like to have.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. No, I really can't think of anything--unless, Torvald--

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Well?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[playing with his coat buttons, and without raising her eyes to his]</SPAN>. If you really want to give me something, you might--you might--

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Well, out with it!

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[speaking quickly]</SPAN>. You might give me money, Torvald. Only just as much as you can afford; and then one of these days I will buy something with it.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. But, Nora--

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Oh, do! dear Torvald; please, please do!  Then I will wrap it up in beautiful gilt paper and hang it on the Christmas Tree. Wouldn't that be fun?

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. What are little people called that are always wasting money?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Spendthrifts--I know. Let us do as you suggest, Torvald, and then I shall have time to think what I am most in want of. That is a very sensible plan, isn't it?

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[smiling]</SPAN>. Indeed it is--that is to say, if you were really to save out of the money I give you, and then really buy something for yourself. But if you spend it all on the housekeeping and any number of unnecessary things, then I merely have to pay up again.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Oh but, Torvald--

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. You can't deny it, my dear little Nora. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Puts his arm round her waist.]</SPAN> It's a sweet little spendthrift, but she uses up a deal of money. One would hardly believe how expensive such little persons are!

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. It's a shame to say that. I do really save all I can.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[laughing]</SPAN>. That's very true,--all you can. But you can't save anything!

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[smiling quietly and happily]</SPAN>. You haven't any idea how many expenses we skylarks and squirrels have, Torvald.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. You are an odd little soul. Very like your father. You always find some new way of wheedling money out of me, and, as soon as you have got it, it seems to melt in your hands. You never know where it has gone. Still, one must take you as you are. It is in the blood; for indeed it is true that you can inherit these things, Nora.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Ah, I wish I had inherited many of papa's qualities.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. And I would not wish you to be anything but just what you are, my sweet little skylark. But, do you know, it strikes me that you are looking rather--what shall I say--rather uneasy today?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Do I?

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. You do, really. Look straight at me.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[looks at him]</SPAN>. Well?

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[wagging his finger at her]</SPAN>. Hasn't Miss Sweet Tooth been breaking rules in town today?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. No; what makes you think that?

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Hasn't she paid a visit to the confectioner's?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. No, I assure you, Torvald--

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Not been nibbling sweets?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. No, certainly not.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Not even taken a bite at a macaroon or two?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. No, Torvald, I assure you really--

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. There, there, of course I was only joking.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[going to the table on the right]</SPAN>. I should not think of going against your wishes.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. No, I am sure of that; besides, you gave me your word-- <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Going up to her.]</SPAN> Keep your little Christmas secrets to yourself, my darling. They will all be revealed tonight when the Christmas Tree is lit, no doubt.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Did you remember to invite Doctor Rank?

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. No. But there is no need; as a matter of course he will come to dinner with us. However, I will ask him when he comes in this morning. I have ordered some good wine. Nora, you can't think how I am looking forward to this evening.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. So am I! And how the children will enjoy themselves, Torvald!

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. It is splendid to feel that one has a perfectly safe appointment, and a big enough income. It's delightful to think of, isn't it?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. It's wonderful!

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Do you remember last Christmas? For a full three weeks beforehand you shut yourself up every evening until long after midnight, making ornaments for the Christmas Tree, and all the other fine things that were to be a surprise to us. It was the dullest three weeks I ever spent!

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. I didn't find it dull.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[smiling]</SPAN>. But there was precious little result, Nora.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Oh, you shouldn't tease me about that again. How could I help the cat's going in and tearing everything to pieces?

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Of course you couldn't, poor little girl. You had the best of intentions to please us all, and that's the main thing. But it is a good thing that our hard times are over.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Yes, it is really wonderful.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. This time I needn't sit here and be dull all alone, and you needn't ruin your dear eyes and your pretty little hands--

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[clapping her hands]</SPAN>. No, Torvald, I needn't any longer, need I!  It's wonderfully lovely to hear you say so! <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Taking his arm.]</SPAN> Now I will tell you how I have been thinking we ought to arrange things, Torvald. As soon as Christmas is over--<SPAN class="stage-direction">[A bell rings in the hall.]</SPAN> There's the bell. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[She tidies the room a little.]</SPAN> There's some one at the door. What a nuisance!

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. If it is a caller, remember I am not at home.

<P><SPAN class="character">Maid </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[in the doorway]</SPAN>. A lady to see you, ma'am,--a stranger.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Ask her to come in.

<P><SPAN class="character">Maid </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[to HELMER]</SPAN>. The doctor came at the same time, sir.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Did he go straight into my room?

<P><SPAN class="character">Maid</SPAN>. Yes, sir.

<P><SPAN class="stage-direction">[HELMER goes into his room. The MAID ushers in Mrs Linde, who is in travelling dress, and shuts the door.]</SPAN>

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN> <SPAN class="stage-direction">[in a dejected and timid voice]</SPAN>. How do you do, Nora?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[doubtfully]</SPAN>. How do you do--

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. You don't recognise me, I suppose.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. No, I don't know--yes, to be sure, I seem to--<SPAN class="stage-direction">[Suddenly.]</SPAN> Yes! Christine! Is it really you?

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. Yes, it is I.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Christine! To think of my not recognising you! And yet how could I--<SPAN class="stage-direction">[In a gentle voice.]</SPAN> How you have altered, Christine!

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. Yes, I have indeed. In nine, ten long years--

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Is it so long since we met? I suppose it is. The last eight years have been a happy time for me, I can tell you. And so now you have come into the town, and have taken this long journey in winter--that was plucky of you.

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. I arrived by steamer this morning.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. To have some fun at Christmas-time, of course. How delightful! We will have such fun together! But take off your things. You are not cold, I hope. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Helps her.]</SPAN> Now we will sit down by the stove, and be cosy. No, take this armchair; I will sit here in the rocking-chair. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Takes her hands.]</SPAN> Now you look like your old self again; it was only the first moment--You are a little paler, Christine, and perhaps a little thinner.

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. And much, much older, Nora.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Perhaps a little older; very, very little; certainly not much. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Stops suddenly and speaks seriously.]</SPAN> What a thoughtless creature I am, chattering away like this. My poor, dear Christine, do forgive me.

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. What do you mean, Nora?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[gently]</SPAN>. Poor Christine, you are a widow.

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. Yes; it is three years ago now.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Yes, I knew; I saw it in the papers. I assure you, Christine, I meant ever so often to write to you at the time, but I always put it off and something always prevented me.

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. I quite understand, dear.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. It was very bad of me, Christine. Poor thing, how you must have suffered. And he left you nothing?

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. No.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. And no children?

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. No.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Nothing at all, then.

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. Not even any sorrow or grief to live upon.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[looking incredulously at her]</SPAN>. But, Christine, is that possible?

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN> <SPAN class="stage-direction">[smiles sadly and strokes her hair]</SPAN>. It sometimes happens, Nora.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. So you are quite alone. How dreadfully sad that must be. I have three lovely children. You can't see them just now, for they are out with their nurse. But now you must tell me all about it.

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. No, no; I want to hear about you.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. No, you must begin. I mustn't be selfish today; today I must only think of your affairs. But there is one thing I must tell you. Do you know we have just had a great piece of good luck?

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. No, what is it?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Just fancy, my husband has been made manager of the Bank!

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. Your husband? What good luck!

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Yes, tremendous! A barrister's profession is such an uncertain thing, especially if he won't undertake unsavoury cases; and naturally Torvald has never been willing to do that, and I quite agree with him. You may imagine how pleased we are! He is to take up his work in the Bank at the New Year, and then he will have a big salary and lots of commissions. For the future we can live quite differently--we can do just as we like. I feel so relieved and so happy, Christine! It will be splendid to have heaps of money and not need to have any anxiety, won't it?

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. Yes, anyhow I think it would be delightful to have what one needs.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. No, not only what one needs, but heaps and heaps of money.

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN> <SPAN class="stage-direction">[smiling]</SPAN>. Nora, Nora, haven't you learned sense yet? In our schooldays you were a great spendthrift.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[laughing]</SPAN>. Yes, that is what Torvald says now. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Wags her finger at her.]</SPAN> But "Nora, Nora" is not so silly as you think. We have not been in a position for me to waste money. We have both had to work.

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. You too?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Yes; odds and ends, needlework, crotchet-work, embroidery, and that kind of thing. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Dropping her voice.]</SPAN> And other things as well. You know Torvald left his office when we were married? There was no prospect of promotion there, and he had to try and earn more than before. But during the first year he over-worked himself dreadfully. You see, he had to make money every way he could, and he worked early and late; but he couldn't stand it, and fell dreadfully ill, and the doctors said it was necessary for him to go south.

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. You spent a whole year in Italy, didn't you?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>.  Yes. It was no easy matter to get away, I can tell you. It was just after Ivar was born; but naturally we had to go. It was a wonderfully beautiful journey, and it saved Torvald's life. But it cost a tremendous lot of money, Christine.

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. So I should think.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. It cost about two hundred and fifty pounds. That's a lot, isn't it?

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. Yes, and in emergencies like that it is lucky to have the money.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. I ought to tell you that we had it from papa.

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. Oh, I see. It was just about that time that he died, wasn't it?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Yes; and, just think of it, I couldn't go and nurse him. I was expecting little Ivar's birth every day and I had my poor sick Torvald to look after. My dear, kind father--I never saw him again, Christine. That was the saddest time I have known since our marriage.

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. I know how fond you were of him. And then you went off to Italy?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Yes; you see we had money then, and the doctors insisted on our going, so we started a month later.

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. And your husband came back quite well?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. As sound as a bell!

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. But--the doctor?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. What doctor?

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. I thought your maid said the gentleman who arrived here just as I did, was the doctor?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Yes, that was Doctor Rank, but he doesn't come here professionally. He is our greatest friend, and comes in at least once everyday. No, Torvald has not had an hour's illness since then, and our children are strong and healthy and so am I. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Jumps up and claps her hands.]</SPAN> Christine! Christine! it's good to be alive and happy!--But how horrid of me; I am talking of nothing but my own affairs. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Sits on a stool near her, and rests her arms on her knees.]</SPAN> You mustn't be angry with me. Tell me, is it really true that you did not love your husband? Why did you marry him?

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. My mother was alive then, and was bedridden and helpless, and I had to provide for my two younger brothers; so I did not think I was justified in refusing his offer.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. No, perhaps you were quite right. He was rich at that time, then?

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. I believe he was quite well off. But his business was a precarious one; and, when he died, it all went to pieces and there was nothing left.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. And then?--

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. Well, I had to turn my hand to anything I could find- -first a small shop, then a small school, and so on. The last three years have seemed like one long working-day, with no rest. Now it is at an end, Nora. My poor mother needs me no more, for she is gone; and the boys do not need me either; they have got situations and can shift for themselves.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. What a relief you must feel if--

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. No, indeed; I only feel my life unspeakably empty. No one to live for anymore. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Gets up restlessly.]</SPAN> That was why I could not stand the life in my little backwater any longer. I hope it may be easier here to find something which will busy me and occupy my thoughts. If only I could have the good luck to get some regular work--office work of some kind--

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. But, Christine, that is so frightfully tiring, and you look tired out now. You had far better go away to some watering-place.

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN> <SPAN class="stage-direction">[walking to the window]</SPAN>. I have no father to give me money for a journey, Nora.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[rising]</SPAN>. Oh, don't be angry with me!

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN> <SPAN class="stage-direction">[going up to her]</SPAN>. It is you that must not be angry with me, dear. The worst of a position like mine is that it makes one so bitter. No one to work for, and yet obliged to be always on the lookout for chances. One must live, and so one becomes selfish. When you told me of the happy turn your fortunes have taken--you will hardly believe it--I was delighted not so much on your account as on my own.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. How do you mean?--Oh, I understand. You mean that perhaps Torvald could get you something to do.

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. Yes, that was what I was thinking of.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. He must, Christine. Just leave it to me; I will broach the subject very cleverly--I will think of something that will please him very much. It will make me so happy to be of some use to you.

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. How kind you are, Nora, to be so anxious to help me! It is doubly kind in you, for you know so little of the burdens and troubles of life.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. I--? I know so little of them?

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN> <SPAN class="stage-direction">[smiling]</SPAN>. My dear! Small household cares and that sort of thing!--You are a child, Nora.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[tosses her head and crosses the stage]</SPAN>. You ought not to be so superior.

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. No?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. You are just like the others. They all think that I am incapable of anything really serious--

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. Come, come--

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>.--that I have gone through nothing in this world of cares.

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. But, my dear Nora, you have just told me all your troubles.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Pooh!--those were trifles. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Lowering her voice.]</SPAN> I have not told you the important thing.

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. The important thing? What do you mean?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. You look down upon me altogether, Christine--but you ought not to. You are proud, aren't you, of having worked so hard and so long for your mother?

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. Indeed, I don't look down on anyone. But it is true that I am both proud and glad to think that I was privileged to make the end of my mother's life almost free from care.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. And you are proud to think of what you have done for your brothers?

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. I think I have the right to be.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. I think so, too. But now, listen to this; I too have something to be proud and glad of.

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. I have no doubt you have. But what do you refer to?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Speak low. Suppose Torvald were to hear! He mustn't on any account--no one in the world must know, Christine, except you.

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. But what is it?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Come here. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Pulls her down on the sofa beside her.]</SPAN> Now I will show you that I too have something to be proud and glad of. It was I who saved Torvald's life.

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. "Saved"? How?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. I told you about our trip to Italy. Torvald would never have recovered if he had not gone there--

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. Yes, but your father gave you the necessary funds.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[smiling]</SPAN>. Yes, that is what Torvald and all the others think, but--

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. But--

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Papa didn't give us a shilling. It was I who procured the money.

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. You? All that large sum?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Two hundred and fifty pounds. What do you think of that?

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. But, Nora, how could you possibly do it? Did you win a prize in the Lottery?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[contemptuously]</SPAN>. In the Lottery? There would have been no credit in that.

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. But where did you get it from, then? Nora <SPAN class="stage-direction">[humming and smiling with an air of mystery]</SPAN>. Hm, hm! Aha!

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. Because you couldn't have borrowed it.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Couldn't I? Why not?

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. No, a wife cannot borrow without her husband's consent.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[tossing her head]</SPAN>. Oh, if it is a wife who has any head for business--a wife who has the wit to be a little bit clever--

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. I don't understand it at all, Nora.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. There is no need you should. I never said I had borrowed the money. I may have got it some other way. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Lies back on the sofa.]</SPAN> Perhaps I got it from some other admirer. When anyone is as attractive as I am--

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. You are a mad creature.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Now, you know you're full of curiosity, Christine.

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. Listen to me, Nora dear. Haven't you been a little bit imprudent?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[sits up straight]</SPAN>. Is it imprudent to save your husband's life?

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. It seems to me imprudent, without his knowledge, to--

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. But it was absolutely necessary that he should not know! My goodness, can't you understand that? It was necessary he should have no idea what a dangerous condition he was in. It was to me that the doctors came and said that his life was in danger, and that the only thing to save him was to live in the south. Do you suppose I didn't try, first of all, to get what I wanted as if it were for myself? I told him how much I should love to travel abroad like other young wives; I tried tears and entreaties with him; I told him that he ought to remember the condition I was in, and that he ought to be kind and indulgent to me; I even hinted that he might raise a loan. That nearly made him angry, Christine. He said I was thoughtless, and that it was his duty as my husband not to indulge me in my whims and caprices--as I believe he called them. Very well, I thought, you must be saved--and that was how I came to devise a way out of the difficulty--

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. And did your husband never get to know from your father that the money had not come from him?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. No, never. Papa died just at that time. I had meant to let him into the secret and beg him never to reveal it. But he was so ill then--alas, there never was any need to tell him.

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. And since then have you never told your secret to your husband?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Good Heavens, no! How could you think so? A man who has such strong opinions about these things! And besides, how painful and humiliating it would be for Torvald, with his manly independence, to know that he owed me anything! It would upset our mutual relations altogether; our beautiful happy home would no longer be what it is now.

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. Do you mean never to tell him about it?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[meditatively, and with a half smile]</SPAN>. Yes--someday, perhaps, after many years, when I am no longer as nice-looking as I am now. Don't laugh at me! I mean, of course, when Torvald is no longer as devoted to me as he is now; when my dancing and dressing-up and reciting have palled on him; then it may be a good thing to have something in reserve--<SPAN class="stage-direction">[Breaking off.]</SPAN> What nonsense! That time will never come. Now, what do you think of my great secret, Christine? Do you still think I am of no use? I can tell you, too, that this affair has caused me a lot of worry. It has been by no means easy for me to meet my engagements punctually. I may tell you that there is something that is called, in business, quarterly interest, and another thing called payment in installments, and it is always so dreadfully difficult to manage them. I have had to save a little here and there, where I could, you understand. I have not been able to put aside much from my housekeeping money, for Torvald must have a good table. I couldn't let my children be shabbily dressed; I have felt obliged to use up all he gave me for them, the sweet little darlings!

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. So it has all had to come out of your own necessaries of life, poor Nora?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Of course. Besides, I was the one responsible for it. Whenever Torvald has given me money for new dresses and such things, I have never spent more than half of it; I have always bought the simplest and cheapest things. Thank Heaven, any clothes look well on me, and so Torvald has never noticed it. But it was often very hard on me, Christine--because it is delightful to be really well dressed, isn't it?

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. Quite so.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Well, then I have found other ways of earning money. Last winter I was lucky enough to get a lot of copying to do; so I locked myself up and sat writing every evening until quite late at night. Many a time I was desperately tired; but all the same it was a tremendous pleasure to sit there working and earning money. It was like being a man.

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. How much have you been able to pay off in that way?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. I can't tell you exactly. You see, it is very difficult to keep an account of a business matter of that kind. I only know that I have paid every penny that I could scrape together. Many a time I was at my wits' end. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Smiles.]</SPAN> Then I used to sit here and imagine that a rich old gentleman had fallen in love with me--

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. What! Who was it?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Be quiet!--that he had died; and that when his will was opened it contained, written in big letters, the instruction: "The lovely Mrs Nora Helmer is to have all I possess paid over to her at once in cash."

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. But, my dear Nora--who could the man be?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Good gracious, can't you understand? There was no old gentleman at all; it was only something that I used to sit here and imagine, when I couldn't think of any way of procuring money. But it's all the same now; the tiresome old person can stay where he is, as far as I am concerned; I don't care about him or his will either, for I am free from care now. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Jumps up.]</SPAN> My goodness, it's delightful to think of, Christine! Free from care! To be able to be free from care, quite free from care; to be able to play and romp with the children; to be able to keep the house beautifully and have everything just as Torvald likes it! And, think of it, soon the spring will come and the big blue sky! Perhaps we shall be able to take a little trip--perhaps I shall see the sea again! Oh, it's a wonderful thing to be alive and be happy. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[A bell is heard in the hall.]</SPAN>

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN> <SPAN class="stage-direction">[rising]</SPAN>. There is the bell; perhaps I had better go.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. No, don't go; no one will come in here; it is sure to be for Torvald.

<P><SPAN class="character">Servant </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[at the hall door]</SPAN>. Excuse me, ma'am--there is a gentleman to see the master, and as the doctor is with him--

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Who is it?

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[at the door]</SPAN>. It is I, Mrs Helmer. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Mrs LINDE starts, trembles, and turns to the window.]</SPAN>

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[takes a step towards him, and speaks in a strained, low voice]</SPAN>. You? What is it? What do you want to see my husband about?

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. Bank business--in a way. I have a small post in the Bank, and I hear your husband is to be our chief now--

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Then it is--

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. Nothing but dry business matters, Mrs Helmer; absolutely nothing else.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Be so good as to go into the study, then. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[She bows indifferently to him and shuts the door into the hall; then comes back and makes up the fire in the stove.]</SPAN>

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. Nora--who was that man?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. A lawyer, of the name of Krogstad.

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. Then it really was he.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Do you know the man?

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. I used to--many years ago. At one time he was a solicitor's clerk in our town.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Yes, he was.

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. He is greatly altered.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. He made a very unhappy marriage.

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. He is a widower now, isn't he?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. With several children. There now, it is burning up. Shuts the door of the stove and moves the rocking-chair aside.]

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. They say he carries on various kinds of business.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Really! Perhaps he does; I don't know anything about it. But don't let us think of business; it is so tiresome.

<P><SPAN class="character">Doctor Rank </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[comes out of HELMER'S study. Before he shuts the door he calls to him]</SPAN>. No, my dear fellow, I won't disturb you; I would rather go in to your wife for a little while. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Shuts the door and sees Mrs LINDE.]</SPAN> I beg your pardon; I am afraid I am disturbing you too.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. No, not at all. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Introducing him]</SPAN>. Doctor Rank, Mrs Linde.

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank</SPAN>. I have often heard Mrs Linde's name mentioned here. I think I passed you on the stairs when I arrived, Mrs Linde?

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. Yes, I go up very slowly; I can't manage stairs well.

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank</SPAN>. Ah! some slight internal weakness?

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. No, the fact is I have been overworking myself.

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank</SPAN>. Nothing more than that? Then I suppose you have come to town to amuse yourself with our entertainments?

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. I have come to look for work.

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank</SPAN>. Is that a good cure for overwork?

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. One must live, Doctor Rank.

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank</SPAN>. Yes, the general opinion seems to be that it is necessary.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Look here, Doctor Rank--you know you want to live.

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank</SPAN>. Certainly. However wretched I may feel, I want to prolong the agony as long as possible. All my patients are like that. And so are those who are morally diseased; one of them, and a bad case too, is at this very moment with Helmer--

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN> <SPAN class="stage-direction">[sadly]</SPAN>. Ah!

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Whom do you mean?

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank</SPAN>. A lawyer of the name of Krogstad, a fellow you don't know at all. He suffers from a diseased moral character, Mrs Helmer; but even he began talking of its being highly important that he should live.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Did he? What did he want to speak to Torvald about?

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank</SPAN>. I have no idea; I only heard that it was something about the Bank.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. I didn't know this--what's his name--Krogstad had anything to do with the Bank.

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank</SPAN>. Yes, he has some sort of appointment there. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[To Mrs Linde.]</SPAN> I don't know whether you find also in your part of the world that there are certain people who go zealously snuffing about to smell out moral corruption, and, as soon as they have found some, put the person concerned into some lucrative position where they can keep their eye on him. Healthy natures are left out in the cold.

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. Still I think the sick are those who most need taking care of.

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[shrugging his shoulders]</SPAN>. Yes, there you are. That is the sentiment that is turning Society into a sick-house.

<P><SPAN class="stage-direction">[NORA, who has been absorbed in her thoughts, breaks out into smothered laughter and claps her hands.]</SPAN>

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank</SPAN>. Why do you laugh at that? Have you any notion what Society really is?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. What do I care about tiresome Society? I am laughing at something quite different, something extremely amusing. Tell me, Doctor Rank, are all the people who are employed in the Bank dependent on Torvald now?

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank</SPAN>. Is that what you find so extremely amusing?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[smiling and humming]</SPAN>. That's my affair! <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Walking about the room.]</SPAN> It's perfectly glorious to think that we have--that Torvald has so much power over so many people. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Takes the packet from her pocket.]</SPAN> Doctor Rank, what do you say to a macaroon?

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank</SPAN>. What, macaroons? I thought they were forbidden here.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Yes, but these are some Christine gave me.

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. What! I?--

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Oh, well, don't be alarmed! You couldn't know that Torvald had forbidden them. I must tell you that he is afraid they will spoil my teeth. But, bah!--once in a way--That's so, isn't it, Doctor Rank? By your leave! <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Puts a macaroon into his mouth.]</SPAN> You must have one too, Christine. And I shall have one, just a little one--or at most two. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Walking about.]</SPAN> I am tremendously happy. There is just one thing in the world now that I should dearly love to do.

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank</SPAN>. Well, what is that?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. It's something I should dearly love to say, if Torvald could hear me.

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank</SPAN>. Well, why can't you say it?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. No, I daren't; it's so shocking.

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. Shocking?

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank</SPAN>. Well, I should not advise you to say it. Still, with us you might. What is it you would so much like to say if Torvald could hear you?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. I should just love to say--Well, I'm damned!

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank</SPAN>. Are you mad?

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. Nora, dear--!

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank</SPAN>. Say it, here he is!

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[hiding the packet]</SPAN>. Hush! Hush! Hush! <SPAN class="stage-direction">[HELMER comes out of his room, with his coat over his arm and his hat in his hand.]</SPAN>

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Well, Torvald dear, have you got rid of him?

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Yes, he has just gone.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Let me introduce you--this is Christine, who has come to town.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Christine--? Excuse me, but I don't know--

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Mrs Linde, dear; Christine Linde.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Of course. A school friend of my wife's, I presume?

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. Yes, we have known each other since then.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. And just think, she has taken a long journey in order to see you.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. What do you mean?

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. No, really, I--

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Christine is tremendously clever at book-keeping, and she is frightfully anxious to work under some clever man, so as to perfect herself--

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Very sensible, Mrs Linde.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. And when she heard you had been appointed manager of the Bank--the news was telegraphed, you know--she travelled here as quick as she could. Torvald, I am sure you will be able to do something for Christine, for my sake, won't you?

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Well, it is not altogether impossible. I presume you are a widow, Mrs Linde?

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. Yes.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. And have had some experience of book-keeping?

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. Yes, a fair amount.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Ah! well, it's very likely I may be able to find something for you--

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[clapping her hands]</SPAN>. What did I tell you? What did I tell you?

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. You have just come at a fortunate moment, Mrs Linde.

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. How am I to thank you?

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. There is no need. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Puts on his coat.]</SPAN> But today you must excuse me--

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank</SPAN>. Wait a minute; I will come with you. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Brings his fur coat from the hall and warms it at the fire.]</SPAN>

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Don't be long away, Torvald dear.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. About an hour, not more.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Are you going too, Christine?

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN> <SPAN class="stage-direction">[putting on her cloak]</SPAN>. Yes, I must go and look for a room.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Oh, well then, we can walk down the street together.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[helping her]</SPAN>. What a pity it is we are so short of space here; I am afraid it is impossible for us--

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. Please don't think of it! Goodbye, Nora dear, and many thanks.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Goodbye for the present. Of course you will come back this evening. And you too, Dr. Rank. What do you say? If you are well enough? Oh, you must be! Wrap yourself up well. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[They go to the door all talking together. Children's voices are heard on the staircase.]</SPAN>

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. There they are! There they are! <SPAN class="stage-direction">[She runs to open the door. The NURSE comes in with the children.]</SPAN> Come in! Come in! <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Stoops and kisses them.]</SPAN> Oh, you sweet blessings! Look at them, Christine! Aren't they darlings?

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank</SPAN>. Don't let us stand here in the draught.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Come along, Mrs Linde; the place will only be bearable for a mother now!

<P><SPAN class="stage-direction">[RANK, HELMER, and Mrs Linde go downstairs. The NURSE comes forward with the children; NORA shuts the hall door.]</SPAN>

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. How fresh and well you look! Such red cheeks like apples and roses. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[The children all talk at once while she speaks to them.]</SPAN> Have you had great fun? That's splendid! What, you pulled both Emmy and Bob along on the sledge? --both at once?--that was good. You are a clever boy, Ivar. Let me take her for a little, Anne. My sweet little baby doll! <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Takes the baby from the MAID and dances it up and down.]</SPAN> Yes, yes, mother will dance with Bob too. What! Have you been snowballing? I wish I had been there too! No, no, I will take their things off, Anne; please let me do it, it is such fun. Go in now, you look half frozen. There is some hot coffee for you on the stove.

<P><SPAN class="stage-direction">[The NURSE goes into the room on the left. NORA takes off the children's things and throws them about, while they all talk to her at once.]</SPAN>

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Really! Did a big dog run after you? But it didn't bite you? No, dogs don't bite nice little dolly children. You mustn't look at the parcels, Ivar. What are they? Ah, I daresay you would like to know. No, no--it's something nasty! Come, let us have a game! What shall we play at? Hide and Seek? Yes, we'll play Hide and Seek. Bob shall hide first. Must I hide? Very well, I'll hide first. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[She and the children laugh and shout, and romp in and out of the room; at last NORA hides under the table, the children rush in and out for her, but do not see her; they hear her smothered laughter, run to the table, lift up the cloth and find her.

The door is half opened, and KROGSTAD appears, lie waits a little; the game goes on.]</SPAN>

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. Excuse me, Mrs Helmer.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[with a stifled cry, turns round and gets up on to her knees]</SPAN>. Ah! what do you want?

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. Excuse me, the outer door was ajar; I suppose someone forgot to shut it.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[rising]</SPAN>. My husband is out, Mr. Krogstad.

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. I know that.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. What do you want here, then?

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. A word with you.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. With me?--<SPAN class="stage-direction">[To the children, gently.]</SPAN> Go in to nurse. What? No, the strange man won't do mother any harm. When he has gone we will have another game. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[She takes the children into the room on the left, and shuts the door after them.]</SPAN> You want to speak to me?

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. Yes, I do.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Today? It is not the first of the month yet.

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. No, it is Christmas Eve, and it will depend on yourself what sort of a Christmas you will spend.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. What do you mean? Today it is absolutely impossible for me--

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. We won't talk about that until later on. This is something different. I presume you can give me a moment?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Yes--yes, I can--although--

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. Good. I was in Olsen's Restaurant and saw your husband going down the street--

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Yes?

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. With a lady.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. What then?

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. May I make so bold as to ask if it was a Mrs Linde?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. It was.

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. Just arrived in town?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Yes, today.

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. She is a great friend of yours, isn't she?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. She is. But I don't see--

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. I knew her too, once upon a time.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. I am aware of that.

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. Are you? So you know all about it; I thought as much. Then I can ask you, without beating about the bush--is Mrs Linde to have an appointment in the Bank?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. What right have you to question me, Mr. Krogstad?--You, one of my husband's subordinates! But since you ask, you shall know. Yes, Mrs Linde is to have an appointment. And it was I who pleaded her cause, Mr. Krogstad, let me tell you that.

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. I was right in what I thought, then.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[walking up and down the stage]</SPAN>. Sometimes one has a tiny little bit of influence, I should hope. Because one is a woman, it does not necessarily follow that--. When anyone is in a subordinate position, Mr. Krogstad, they should really be careful to avoid offending anyone who--who--

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. Who has influence?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Exactly.

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[changing his tone]</SPAN>. Mrs Helmer, you will be so good as to use your influence on my behalf.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. What? What do you mean?

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. You will be so kind as to see that I am allowed to keep my subordinate position in the Bank.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. What do you mean by that? Who proposes to take your post away from you?

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. Oh, there is no necessity to keep up the pretence of ignorance. I can quite understand that your friend is not very anxious to expose herself to the chance of rubbing shoulders with me; and I quite understand, too, whom I have to thank for being turned off.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. But I assure you--

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. Very likely; but, to come to the point, the time has come when I should advise you to use your influence to prevent that.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. But, Mr. Krogstad, I have no influence.

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. Haven't you? I thought you said yourself just now--

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Naturally I did not mean you to put that construction on it. I! What should make you think I have any influence of that kind with my husband?

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. Oh, I have known your husband from our student days. I don't suppose he is any more unassailable than other husbands.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. If you speak slightingly of my husband, I shall turn you out of the house.

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. You are bold, Mrs Helmer.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. I am not afraid of you any longer. As soon as the New Year comes, I shall in a very short time be free of the whole thing.

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[controlling himself]</SPAN>. Listen to me, Mrs Helmer. If necessary] I am prepared to fight for my small post in the Bank as if I were fighting for my life.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. So it seems.

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. It is not only for the sake of the money; indeed, that weighs least with me in the matter. There is another reason-- well, I may as well tell you. My position is this. I daresay you know, like everybody else, that once, many years ago, I was guilty of an indiscretion.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. I think I have heard something of the kind.

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. The matter never came into court; but every way seemed to be closed to me after that. So I took to the business that you know of. I had to do something; and, honestly, I don't think I've been one of the worst. But now I must cut myself free from all that. My sons are growing up; for their sake I must try and win back as much respect as I can in the town. This post in the Bank was like the first step up for me--and now your husband is going to kick me downstairs again into the mud.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. But you must believe me, Mr. Krogstad; it is not in my power to help you at all.

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. Then it is because you haven't the will; but I have means to compel you.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. You don't mean that you will tell my husband that I owe you money?

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. Hm!--suppose I were to tell him?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. It would be perfectly infamous of you. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Sobbing.]</SPAN> To think of his learning my secret, which has been my joy and pride, in such an ugly, clumsy way--that he should learn it from you! And it would put me in a horribly disagreeable position--

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. Only disagreeable?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[impetuously]</SPAN>. Well, do it, then!--and it will be the worse for you. My husband will see for himself what a blackguard you are, and you certainly won't keep your post then.

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. I asked you if it was only a disagreeable scene at home that you were afraid of?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. If my husband does get to know of it, of course he will at once pay you what is still owing, and we shall have nothing more to do with you.

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[coming a step nearer]</SPAN>. Listen to me, Mrs Helmer. Either you have a very bad memory or you know very little of business. I shall be obliged to remind you of a few details.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. What do you mean?

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. When your husband was ill, you came to me to borrow two hundred and fifty pounds.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. I didn't know anyone else to go to.

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. I promised to get you that amount--

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Yes, and you did so.

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. I promised to get you that amount, on certain conditions. Your mind was so taken up with your husband's illness, and you were so anxious to get the money for your journey, that you seem to have paid no attention to the conditions of our bargain. Therefore it will not be amiss if I remind you of them. Now, I promised to get the money on the security of a bond which I drew up.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Yes, and which I signed.

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. Good. But below your signature there were a few lines constituting your father a surety for the money; those lines your father should have signed.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Should? He did sign them.

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. I had left the date blank; that is to say, your father should himself have inserted the date on which he signed the paper. Do you remember that?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Yes, I think I remember--

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. Then I gave you the bond to send by post to your father. Is that not so?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Yes.

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. And you naturally did so at once, because five or six days afterwards you brought me the bond with your father's signature. And then I gave you the money.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Well, haven't I been paying it off regularly?

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. Fairly so, yes. But--to come back to the matter in hand--that must have been a very trying time for you, Mrs Helmer?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. It was, indeed.

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. Your father was very ill, wasn't he?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. He was very near his end.

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. And died soon afterwards?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Yes.

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. Tell me, Mrs Helmer, can you by any chance remember what day your father died?--on what day of the month, I mean.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Papa died on the 29th of September.

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. That is correct; I have ascertained it for myself. And, as that is so, there is a discrepancy <SPAN class="stage-direction">[taking a paper from his pocket]</SPAN> which I cannot account for.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. What discrepancy? I don't know--

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. The discrepancy consists, Mrs Helmer, in the fact that your father signed this bond three days after his death.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. What do you mean? I don't understand--

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. Your father died on the 29th of September. But, look here; your father has dated his signature the 2nd of October. It is a discrepancy, isn't it? <SPAN class="stage-direction">[NORA is silent.]</SPAN> Can you explain it to me? <SPAN class="stage-direction">[NORA is still silent.]</SPAN> It is a remarkable thing, too, that the words "2nd of October," as well as the year, are not written in your father's handwriting but in one that I think I know. Well, of course it can be explained; your father may have forgotten to date his signature, and someone else may have dated it haphazard before they knew of his death. There is no harm in that. It all depends on the signature of the name; and that is genuine, I suppose, Mrs Helmer? It was your father himself who signed his name here?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[after a short pause, throws her head up and looks defiantly at him]</SPAN>. No, it was not. It was I that wrote papa's name.

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. Are you aware that is a dangerous confession?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. In what way? You shall have your money soon.

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. Let me ask you a question; why did you not send the paper to your father?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. It was impossible; papa was so ill. If I had asked him for his signature, I should have had to tell him what the money was to be used for; and when he was so ill himself I couldn't tell him that my husband's life was in danger--it was impossible.

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. It would have been better for you if you had given up your trip abroad.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. No, that was impossible. That trip was to save my husband's life; I couldn't give that up.

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. But did it never occur to you that you were committing a fraud on me?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. I couldn't take that into account; I didn't trouble myself about you at all. I couldn't bear you, because you put so many heartless difficulties in my way, although you knew what a dangerous condition my husband was in.

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. Mrs Helmer, you evidently do not realise clearly what it is that you have been guilty of. But I can assure you that my one false step, which lost me all my reputation, was nothing more or nothing worse than what you have done.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. You? Do you ask me to believe that you were brave enough to run a risk to save your wife's life?

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. The law cares nothing about motives.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Then it must be a very foolish law.

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. Foolish or not, it is the law by which you will be judged, if I produce this paper in court.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. I don't believe it. Is a daughter not to be allowed to spare her dying father anxiety and care? Is a wife not to be allowed to save her husband's life? I don't know much about law; but I am certain that there must be laws permitting such things as that. Have you no knowledge of such laws--you who are a lawyer? You must be a very poor lawyer, Mr. Krogstad.

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. Maybe. But matters of business--such business as you and I have had together--do you think I don't understand that? Very well. Do as you please. But let me tell you this--if I lose my position a second time, you shall lose yours with me. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[He bows, and goes out through the hall.]</SPAN>

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[appears buried in thought for a short time, then tosses her head]</SPAN>. Nonsense! Trying to frighten me like that!--I am not so silly as he thinks. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Begins to busy herself putting the children's things in order.]</SPAN> And yet--? No, it's impossible! I did it for love's sake.

<P><SPAN class="character">The Children </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[in the doorway on the left]</SPAN>. Mother, the stranger man has gone out through the gate.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Yes, dears, I know. But, don't tell anyone about the stranger man. Do you hear? Not even papa.

<P><SPAN class="character">Children</SPAN>. No, mother; but will you come and play again?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. No, no,--not now.

<P><SPAN class="character">Children</SPAN>. But, mother, you promised us.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Yes, but I can't now. Run away in; I have such a lot to do. Run away in, my sweet little darlings. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[She gets them into the room by degrees and shuts the door on them; then sits down on the sofa, takes up a piece of needlework and sews a few stitches, but soon stops.]</SPAN> No! <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Throws down the work, gets up, goes to the hall door and calls out.]</SPAN> Helen! bring the Tree in. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Goes to the table on the left, opens a drawer, and stops again.]</SPAN> No, no! it is quite impossible!

<P><SPAN class="character">Maid </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[coming in with the Tree]</SPAN>. Where shall I put it, ma'am?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Here, in the middle of the floor.

<P><SPAN class="character">Maid</SPAN>. Shall I get you anything else?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. No, thank you. I have all I want. [Exit MAID.]

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[begins dressing the tree]</SPAN>. A candle here-and flowers here-- The horrible man! It's all nonsense--there's nothing wrong. The tree shall be splendid! I will do everything I can think of to please you, Torvald!--I will sing for you, dance for you--<SPAN class="stage-direction">[HELMER comes in with some papers under his arm.]</SPAN> Oh! are you back already?.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Yes. Has anyone been here?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Here? No.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. That is strange. I saw Krogstad going out of the gate.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Did you? Oh yes, I forgot, Krogstad was here for a moment.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Nora, I can see from your manner that he has been here begging you to say a good word for him.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Yes.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. And you were to appear to do it of your own accord; you were to conceal from me the fact of his having been here; didn't he beg that of you too?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Yes, Torvald, but--

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Nora, Nora, and you would be a party to that sort of thing? To have any talk with a man like that, and give him any sort of promise? And to tell me a lie into the bargain?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. A lie--?

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Didn't you tell me no one had been here? <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Shakes his finger at her.]</SPAN> My little songbird must never do that again. A songbird must have a clean beak to chirp with--no false notes! <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Puts his arm round her waist.]</SPAN> That is so, isn't it? Yes, I am sure it is. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Lets her go.]</SPAN> We will say no more about it. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Sits down by the stove.]</SPAN> How warm and snug it is here! <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Turns over his papers.]</SPAN>

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[after a short pause, during which she busies herself with the Christmas Tree.]</SPAN>  Torvald!

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Yes.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. I am looking forward tremendously to the fancy-dress ball at the Stenborgs' the day after tomorrow.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. And I am tremendously curious to see what you are going to surprise me with.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. It was very silly of me to want to do that.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. What do you mean?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. I can't hit upon anything that will do; everything I think of seems so silly and insignificant.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Does my little Nora acknowledge that at last?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[standing behind his chair with her arms on the back of it]</SPAN>. Are you very busy, Torvald?

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Well--

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. What are all those papers?

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Bank business.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Already?

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. I have got authority from the retiring manager to undertake the necessary changes in the staff and in the rearrangement of the work; and I must make use of the Christmas week for that, so as to have everything in order for the new year.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Then that was why this poor Krogstad--

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Hm!

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[leans against the back of his chair and strokes his hair]</SPAN>. If you hadn't been so busy I should have asked you a tremendously big favour, Torvald.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. What is that? Tell me.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. There is no one has such good taste as you. And I do so want to look nice at the fancy-dress ball. Torvald, couldn't you take me in hand and decide what I shall go as, and what sort of a dress I shall wear?

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Aha! so my obstinate little woman is obliged to get someone to come to her rescue?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Yes, Torvald, I can't get along a bit without your help.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Very well, I will think it over, we shall manage to hit upon something.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. That is nice of you. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Goes to the Christmas Tree. A short pause.]</SPAN> How pretty the red flowers look--. But, tell me, was it really something very bad that this Krogstad was guilty of?

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. He forged someone's name. Have you any idea what that means?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Isn't it possible that he was driven to do it by necessity?

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Yes; or, as in so many cases, by imprudence. I am not so heartless as to condemn a man altogether because of a single false step of that kind.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. No, you wouldn't, would you, Torvald?

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Many a man has been able to retrieve his character, if he has openly confessed his fault and taken his punishment.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Punishment--?

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. But Krogstad did nothing of that sort; he got himself out of it by a cunning trick, and that is why he has gone under altogether.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. But do you think it would--?

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Just think how a guilty man like that has to lie and play the hypocrite with every one, how he has to wear a mask in the presence of those near and dear to him, even before his own wife and children. And about the children--that is the most terrible part of it all, Nora.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. How?

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Because such an atmosphere of lies infects and poisons the whole life of a home. Each breath the children take in such a house is full of the germs of evil.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[coming nearer him]</SPAN>. Are you sure of that?

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. My dear, I have often seen it in the course of my life as a lawyer. Almost everyone who has gone to the bad early in life has had a deceitful mother.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Why do you only say--mother?

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. It seems most commonly to be the mother's influence, though naturally a bad father's would have the same result. Every lawyer is familiar with the fact. This Krogstad, now, has been persistently poisoning his own children with lies and dissimulation; that is why I say he has lost all moral character. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Holds out his hands to her.]</SPAN> That is why my sweet little Nora must promise me not to plead his cause. Give me your hand on it. Come, come, what is this? Give me your hand. There now, that's settled. I assure you it would be quite impossible for me to work with him; I literally feel physically ill when I am in the company of such people.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[takes her hand out of his and goes to the opposite side of the Christmas Tree]</SPAN>. How hot it is in here; and I have such a lot to do.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[getting up and putting his papers in order]</SPAN>. Yes, and I must try and read through some of these before dinner; and I must think about your costume, too. And it is just possible I may have something ready in gold paper to hang up on the Tree. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Puts his hand on her head.]</SPAN> My precious little singing-bird! <SPAN class="stage-direction">[He goes into his room and shuts the door after him.]</SPAN>

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[after a pause, whispers]</SPAN>. No, no--it isn't true. It's impossible; it must be impossible.

<P><SPAN class="stage-direction">[The NURSE opens the door on the left.]</SPAN>

<P><SPAN class="character">Nurse</SPAN>. The little ones are begging so hard to be allowed to come in to mamma.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. No, no, no! Don't let them come in to me! You stay with them, Anne.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nurse</SPAN>. Very well, ma'am. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Shuts the door.]</SPAN>

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[pale with terror]</SPAN>. Deprave my little children? Poison my home? <SPAN class="stage-direction">[A short pause. Then she tosses her head.]</SPAN> It's not true. It can't possibly be true.

<H3>ACT II</H3>

<P><SPAN class="stage-direction">[THE SAME SCENE.--THE Christmas Tree is in the corner by the piano, stripped of its ornaments and with burnt-down candle-ends on its dishevelled branches.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[drops her cloak]</SPAN>. Someone is coming now! <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Goes to the door and listens.]</SPAN> No--it is no one. Of course, no one will come today, Christmas Day--nor tomorrow either.

No, nothing in the letterbox; it is quite empty. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Comes forward.]</SPAN> What rubbish! of course he can't be in earnest about it. Such a thing couldn't happen; it is impossible--I have three little children.

<P><SPAN class="stage-direction">[Enter the NURSE from the room on the left, carrying a big cardboard box.]</SPAN>

<P><SPAN class="character">Nurse</SPAN>. At last I have found the box with the fancy dress.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Thanks; put it on the table.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nurse </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[doing so]</SPAN>. But it is very much in want of mending.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. I should like to tear it into a hundred thousand pieces.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nurse</SPAN>. What an idea! It can easily be put in order--just a little patience.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Yes, I will go and get Mrs Linde to come and help me with it.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nurse</SPAN>. What, out again? In this horrible weather? You will catch cold, ma'am, and make yourself ill.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Well, worse than that might happen. How are the children?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nurse</SPAN>. The poor little souls are playing with their Christmas presents, but--

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Do they ask much for me?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nurse</SPAN>. You see, they are so accustomed to have their mamma with them.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Yes, but, nurse, I shall not be able to be so much with them now as I was before.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nurse</SPAN>. Oh well, young children easily get accustomed to anything.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Do you think so? Do you think they would forget their mother if she went away altogether?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nurse</SPAN>. Good heavens!--went away altogether?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Nurse, I want you to tell me something I have often wondered about--how could you have the heart to put your own child out among strangers?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nurse</SPAN>. I was obliged to, if I wanted to be little Nora's nurse.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Yes, but how could you be willing to do it?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nurse</SPAN>. What, when I was going to get such a good place by it? A poor girl who has got into trouble should be glad to. Besides, that wicked man didn't do a single thing for me.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. But I suppose your daughter has quite forgotten you.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nurse</SPAN>. No, indeed she hasn't. She wrote to me when she was confirmed, and when she was married.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[putting her arms round her neck]</SPAN>. Dear old Anne, you were a good mother to me when I was little.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nurse</SPAN>. Little Nora, poor dear, had no other mother but me.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. And if my little ones had no other mother, I am sure you would-- What nonsense I am talking! <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Opens the box.]</SPAN> Go in to them. Now I must--. You will see tomorrow how charming I shall look.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nurse</SPAN>. I am sure there will be no one at the ball so charming as you, ma'am. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Goes into the room on the left.]</SPAN>

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[begins to unpack the box, but soon pushes it away from her]</SPAN>. If only I dared go out. If only no one would come. If only I could be sure nothing would happen here in the meantime. Stuff and nonsense! No one will come. Only I mustn't think about it. I will brush my muff. What lovely, lovely gloves! Out of my thoughts, out of my thoughts! One, two, three, four, five, six-- <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Screams.]</SPAN> Ah! there is someone coming--. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Makes a movement towards the door, but stands irresolute.]</SPAN>

<P><SPAN class="stage-direction">[Enter Mrs Linde from the hall, where she has taken off her cloak and hat.]</SPAN>

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Oh, it's you, Christine. There is no one else out there, is there? How good of you to come!

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. I heard you were up asking for me.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Yes, I was passing by. As a matter of fact, it is something you could help me with. Let us sit down here on the sofa. Look here. Tomorrow evening there is to be a fancy-dress ball at the Stenborgs', who live above us; and Torvald wants me to go as a Neapolitan fisher-girl, and dance the Tarantella that I learned at Capri.

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. I see; you are going to keep up the character.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Yes, Torvald wants me to. Look, here is the dress; Torvald had it made for me there, but now it is all so torn, and I haven't any idea--

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. We will easily put that right. It is only some of the trimming come unsewn here and there. Needle and thread? Now then, that's all we want.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. It is nice of you.

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN> <SPAN class="stage-direction">[sewing]</SPAN>. So you are going to be dressed up tomorrow Nora. I will tell you what--I shall come in for a moment and see you in your fine feathers. But I have completely forgotten to thank you for a delightful evening yesterday.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[gets up, and crosses the stage]</SPAN>. Well, I don't think yesterday was as pleasant as usual. You ought to have come to town a little earlier, Christine. Certainly Torvald does understand how to make a house dainty and attractive.

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. And so do you, it seems to me; you are not your father's daughter for nothing. But tell me, is Doctor Rank always as depressed as he was yesterday?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. No; yesterday it was very noticeable. I must tell you that he suffers from a very dangerous disease. He has consumption of the spine, poor creature. His father was a horrible man who committed all sorts of excesses; and that is why his son was sickly from childhood, do you understand?

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN> <SPAN class="stage-direction">[dropping her sewing]</SPAN>. But, my dearest Nora, how do you know anything about such things?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[walking about]</SPAN>. Pooh! When you have three children, you get visits now and then from--from married women, who know something of medical matters, and they talk about one thing and another.

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN> <SPAN class="stage-direction">[goes on sewing. A short silence]</SPAN>. Does Doctor Rank come here everyday?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Everyday regularly. He is Torvald's most intimate friend, and a great friend of mine too. He is just like one of the family.

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. But tell me this--is he perfectly sincere? I mean, isn't he the kind of man that is very anxious to make himself agreeable?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Not in the least. What makes you think that?

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. When you introduced him to me yesterday, he declared he had often heard my name mentioned in this house; but afterwards I noticed that your husband hadn't the slightest idea who I was. So how could Doctor Rank--?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. That is quite right, Christine. Torvald is so absurdly fond of me that he wants me absolutely to himself, as he says. At first he used to seem almost jealous if I mentioned any of the dear folk at home, so naturally I gave up doing so. But I often talk about such things with Doctor Rank, because he likes hearing about them.

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. Listen to me, Nora. You are still very like a child in many things, and I am older than you in many ways and have a little more experience. Let me tell you this--you ought to make an end of it with Doctor Rank.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. What ought I to make an end of?

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. Of two things, I think. Yesterday you talked some nonsense about a rich admirer who was to leave you money--

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. An admirer who doesn't exist, unfortunately! But what then?

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. Is Doctor Rank a man of means?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Yes, he is.

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. And has no one to provide for?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. No, no one; but--

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. And comes here everyday?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Yes, I told you so.

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. But how can this well-bred man be so tactless?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. I don't understand you at all.

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. Don't prevaricate, Nora. Do you suppose I don't guess who lent you the two hundred and fifty pounds?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Are you out of your senses? How can you think of such a thing! A friend of ours, who comes here everyday! Do you realise what a horribly painful position that would be?

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. Then it really isn't he?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. No, certainly not. It would never have entered into my head for a moment. Besides, he had no money to lend then; he came into his money afterwards.

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. Well, I think that was lucky for you, my dear Nora.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. No, it would never have come into my head to ask Doctor Rank. Although I am quite sure that if I had asked him--

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. But of course you won't.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Of course not. I have no reason to think it could possibly be necessary. But I am quite sure that if I told Doctor Rank--

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. Behind your husband's back?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. I must make an end of it with the other one, and that will be behind his back too. I must make an end of it with him.

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. Yes, that is what I told you yesterday, but--

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[walking up and down]</SPAN>. A man can put a thing like that straight much easier than a woman--

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. One's husband, yes.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Nonsense! <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Standing still.]</SPAN> When you pay off a debt you get your bond back, don't you?

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. Yes, as a matter of course.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. And can tear it into a hundred thousand pieces, and burn it up--the nasty dirty paper!

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN> <SPAN class="stage-direction">[looks hard at her, lays down her sewing and gets up slowly]</SPAN>. Nora, you are concealing something from me.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Do I look as if I were?

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. Something has happened to you since yesterday morning. Nora, what is it?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[going nearer to her]</SPAN>. Christine! <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Listens.]</SPAN> Hush! there's Torvald come home. Do you mind going in to the children for the present? Torvald can't bear to see dressmaking going on. Let Anne help you.

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN> <SPAN class="stage-direction">[gathering some of the things together]</SPAN>. Certainly -- but I am not going away from here until we have had it out with one another. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[She goes into the room on the left, as HELMER comes in from the hall.]</SPAN>

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[going up to HELMER]</SPAN>. I have wanted you so much, Torvald dear.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Was that the dressmaker?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. No, it was Christine; she is helping me to put my dress in order. You will see I shall look quite smart.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Wasn't that a happy thought of mine, now?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Splendid! But don't you think it is nice of me, too, to do as you wish?

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Nice?--because you do as your husband wishes? Well, well, you little rogue, I am sure you did not mean it in that way. But I am not going to disturb you; you will want to be trying on your dress, I expect.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. I suppose you are going to work.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Yes. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Shows her a bundle of papers.]</SPAN> Look at that. I have just been into the bank. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Turns to go into his room.]</SPAN>

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Torvald.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Yes.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. If your little squirrel were to ask you for something very, very prettily--?

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. What then?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Would you do it?

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. I should like to hear what it is, first.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Your squirrel would run about and do all her tricks if you would be nice, and do what she wants.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Speak plainly.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Your skylark would chirp about in every room, with her song rising and falling--

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Well, my skylark does that anyhow.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. I would play the fairy and dance for you in the moonlight, Torvald.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Nora--you surely don't mean that request you made to me this morning?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[going near him]</SPAN>. Yes, Torvald, I beg you so earnestly--

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Have you really the courage to open up that question again?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Yes, dear, you must do as I ask; you must let Krogstad keep his post in the bank.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. My dear Nora, it is his post that I have arranged Mrs Linde shall have.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Yes, you have been awfully kind about that; but you could just as well dismiss some other clerk instead of Krogstad.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. This is simply incredible obstinacy! Because you chose to give him a thoughtless promise that you would speak for him, I am expected to--

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. That isn't the reason, Torvald. It is for your own sake. This fellow writes in the most scurrilous newspapers; you have told me so yourself. He can do you an unspeakable amount of harm. I am frightened to death of him--

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Ah, I understand; it is recollections of the past that scare you.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. What do you mean?

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Naturally you are thinking of your father.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Yes--yes, of course. Just recall to your mind what these malicious creatures wrote in the papers about papa, and how horribly they slandered him. I believe they would have procured his dismissal if the Department had not sent you over to inquire into it, and if you had not been so kindly disposed and helpful to him.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. My little Nora, there is an important difference between your father and me. Your father's reputation as a public official was not above suspicion. Mine is, and I hope it will continue to be so, as long as I hold my office.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. You never can tell what mischief these men may contrive. We ought to be so well off, so snug and happy here in our peaceful home, and have no cares--you and I and the children, Torvald! That is why I beg you so earnestly--

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. And it is just by interceding for him that you make it impossible for me to keep him. It is already known at the Bank that I mean to dismiss Krogstad. Is it to get about now that the new manager has changed his mind at his wife's bidding--

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. And what if it did?

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Of course!--if only this obstinate little person can get her way! Do you suppose I am going to make myself ridiculous before my whole staff, to let people think that I am a man to be swayed by all sorts of outside influence? I should very soon feel the consequences of it, I can tell you! And besides, there is one thing that makes it quite impossible for me to have Krogstad in the Bank as long as I am manager.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Whatever is that?

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. His moral failings I might perhaps have overlooked, if necessary--

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Yes, you could--couldn't you?

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. And I hear he is a good worker, too. But I knew him when we were boys. It was one of those rash friendships that so often prove an incubus in afterlife. I may as well tell you plainly, we were once on very intimate terms with one another. But this tactless fellow lays no restraint on himself when other people are present. On the contrary, he thinks it gives him the right to adopt a familiar tone with me, and every minute it is "I say, Helmer, old fellow!" and that sort of thing. I assure you it is extremely painful for me. He would make my position in the Bank intolerable.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Torvald, I don't believe you mean that.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Don't you? Why not?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Because it is such a narrow-minded way of looking at things.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. What are you saying? Narrow-minded? Do you think I am narrow-minded?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. No, just the opposite, dear--and it is exactly for that reason.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. It's the same thing. You say my point of view is narrow- minded, so I must be so too. Narrow-minded! Very well--I must put an end to this. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Goes to the hall door and calls.]</SPAN> Helen!

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. What are you going to do?

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[looking among his papers]</SPAN>. Settle it. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Enter MAID.]</SPAN> Look here; take this letter and go downstairs with it at once. Find a messenger and tell him to deliver it, and be quick. The address is on it, and here is the money.

<P><SPAN class="character">Maid</SPAN>. Very well, sir. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Exit with the letter.]</SPAN>

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[putting his papers together]</SPAN>. Now then, little Miss Obstinate.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[breathlessly]</SPAN>. Torvald--what was that letter?

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Krogstad's dismissal.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Call her back, Torvald! There is still time. Oh Torvald, call her back! Do it for my sake--for your own sake--for the children's sake! Do you hear me, Torvald? Call her back! You don't know what that letter can bring upon us.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. It's too late.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Yes, it's too late.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. My dear Nora, I can forgive the anxiety you are in, although really it is an insult to me. It is, indeed. Isn't it an insult to think that I should be afraid of a starving quill-driver's vengeance? But I forgive you nevertheless, because it is such eloquent witness to your great love for me. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Takes her in his arms.]</SPAN> And that is as it should be, my own darling Nora. Come what will, you may be sure I shall have both courage and strength if they be needed. You will see I am man enough to take everything upon myself.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[in a horror-stricken voice]</SPAN>. What do you mean by that?

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Everything, I say--

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[recovering herself]</SPAN>. You will never have to do that.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. That's right. Well, we will share it, Nora, as man and wife should. That is how it shall be. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Caressing her.]</SPAN> Are you content now? There! There!--not these frightened dove's eyes! The whole thing is only the wildest fancy!--Now, you must go and play through the Tarantella and practise with your tambourine. I shall go into the inner office and shut the door, and I shall hear nothing; you can make as much noise as you please. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Turns back at the door.]</SPAN> And when Rank comes, tell him where he will find me. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Nods to her, takes his papers and goes into his room, and shuts the door after him.]</SPAN>

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[bewildered with anxiety, stands as if rooted to the spot, and whispers]</SPAN>. He was capable of doing it. He will do it. He will do it in spite of everything.--No, not that! Never, never! Anything rather than that!  Oh, for some help, some way out of it! <SPAN class="stage-direction">[The door-bell rings.]</SPAN> Doctor Rank! Anything rather than that--anything, whatever it is! <SPAN class="stage-direction">[She puts her hands over her face, pulls herself together, goes to the door and opens it. RANK is standing without, hanging up his coat. During the following dialogue it begins to grow dark.]</SPAN>

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Good day, Doctor Rank. I knew your ring. But you mustn't go in to Torvald now; I think he is busy with something.

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank</SPAN>. And you?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[brings him in and shuts the door after him]</SPAN>. Oh, you know very well I always have time for you.

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank</SPAN>. Thank you. I shall make use of as much of it as I can.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. What do you mean by that? As much of it as you can?

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank</SPAN>. Well, does that alarm you?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. It was such a strange way of putting it. Is anything likely to happen?

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank</SPAN>. Nothing but what I have long been prepared for. But I certainly didn't expect it to happen so soon.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[gripping him by the arm]</SPAN>. What have you found out? Doctor Rank, you must tell me.

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[sitting down by the stove]</SPAN>. It is all up with me. And it can't be helped.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[with a sigh of relief]</SPAN>. Is it about yourself?

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank</SPAN>. Who else? It is no use lying to one's self. I am the most wretched of all my patients, Mrs Helmer. Lately I have been taking stock of my internal economy. Bankrupt! Probably within a month I shall lie rotting in the churchyard.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. What an ugly thing to say!

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank</SPAN>. The thing itself is cursedly ugly, and the worst of it is that I shall have to face so much more that is ugly before that. I shall only make one more examination of myself; when I have done that, I shall know pretty certainly when it will be that the horrors of dissolution will begin. There is something I want to tell you. Helmer's refined nature gives him an unconquerable disgust at everything that is ugly; I won't have him in my sick- room.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Oh, but, Doctor Rank--

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank</SPAN>. I won't have him there. Not on any account. I bar my door to him. As soon as I am quite certain that the worst has come, I shall send you my card with a black cross on it, and then you will know that the loathsome end has begun.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. You are quite absurd today. And I wanted you so much to be in a really good humour.

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank</SPAN>. With death stalking beside me?--To have to pay this penalty for another man's sin? Is there any justice in that? And in every single family, in one way or another, some such inexorable retribution is being exacted--

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[putting her hands over her ears]</SPAN>. Rubbish! Do talk of something cheerful.

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank</SPAN>. Oh, it's a mere laughing matter, the whole thing. My poor innocent spine has to suffer for my father's youthful amusements.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[sitting at the table on the left]</SPAN>. I suppose you mean that he was too partial to asparagus and pate de foie gras, don't you?

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank</SPAN>. Yes, and to truffles.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Truffles, yes. And oysters too, I suppose?

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank</SPAN>. Oysters, of course, that goes without saying.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. And heaps of port and champagne. It is sad that all these nice things should take their revenge on our bones.

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank</SPAN>. Especially that they should revenge themselves on the unlucky bones of those who have not had the satisfaction of enjoying them.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Yes, that's the saddest part of it all.

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[with a searching look at her]</SPAN>. Hm!--

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[after a short pause]</SPAN>. Why did you smile?

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank</SPAN>. No, it was you that laughed.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. No, it was you that smiled, Doctor Rank!

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[rising]</SPAN>. You are a greater rascal than I thought.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. I am in a silly mood today.

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank</SPAN>. So it seems.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[putting her hands on his shoulders]</SPAN>. Dear, dear Doctor Rank, death mustn't take you away from Torvald and me.

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank</SPAN>. It is a loss you would easily recover from. Those who are gone are soon forgotten.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[looking at him anxiously]</SPAN>. Do you believe that?

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank</SPAN>. People form new ties, and then--

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Who will form new ties?

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank</SPAN>. Both you and Helmer, when I am gone. You yourself are already on the high road to it, I think. What did that Mrs Linde want here last night?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Oho!--you don't mean to say you are jealous of poor Christine?

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank</SPAN>. Yes, I am. She will be my successor in this house. When I am done for, this woman will--

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Hush! don't speak so loud. She is in that room.

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank</SPAN>. Today again. There, you see.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. She has only come to sew my dress for me. Bless my soul, how unreasonable you are! <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Sits down on the sofa.]</SPAN> Be nice now, Doctor Rank, and tomorrow you will see how beautifully I shall dance, and you can imagine I am doing it all for you--and for Torvald too, of course. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Takes various things out of the box.]</SPAN> Doctor Rank, come and sit down here, and I will show you something.

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[sitting down]</SPAN>. What is it?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Just look at those!

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank</SPAN>. Silk stockings.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Flesh-coloured. Aren't they lovely? It is so dark here now, but tomorrow--. No, no, no! you must only look at the feet. Oh well, you may have leave to look at the legs too.

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank</SPAN>. Hm!--

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Why are you looking so critical? Don't you think they will fit me?

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank</SPAN>. I have no means of forming an opinion about that.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[looks at him for a moment]</SPAN>. For shame! <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Hits him lightly on the ear with the stockings.]</SPAN> That's to punish you. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Folds them up again.]</SPAN>

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank</SPAN>. And what other nice things am I to be allowed to see?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Not a single thing more, for being so naughty. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[She looks among the things, humming to herself.]</SPAN>

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[after a short silence]</SPAN>. When I am sitting here, talking to you as intimately as this, I cannot imagine for a moment what would have become of me if I had never come into this house.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[smiling]</SPAN>. I believe you do feel thoroughly at home with us.

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[in a lower voice, looking straight in front of him]</SPAN>. And to be obliged to leave it all--

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Nonsense, you are not going to leave it.

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[as before]</SPAN>. And not be able to leave behind one the slightest token of one's gratitude, scarcely even a fleeting regret--nothing but an empty place which the first comer can fill as well as any other.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. And if I asked you now for a--? No!

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank</SPAN>. For what?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. For a big proof of your friendship--

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank</SPAN>. Yes, yes!

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. I mean a tremendously big favour--

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank</SPAN>. Would you really make me so happy for once?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Ah, but you don't know what it is yet.

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank</SPAN>. No--but tell me.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. I really can't, Doctor Rank. It is something out of all reason; it means advice, and help, and a favour--

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank</SPAN>. The bigger a thing it is the better. I can't conceive what it is you mean. Do tell me. Haven't I your confidence?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. More than anyone else. I know you are my truest and best friend, and so I will tell you what it is. Well, Doctor Rank, it is something you must help me to prevent. You know how devotedly, how inexpressibly deeply Torvald loves me; he would never for a moment hesitate to give his life for me.

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[leaning towards her]</SPAN>. Nora--do you think he is the only one--?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[with a slight start]</SPAN>. The only one--?

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank</SPAN>. The only one who would gladly give his life for your sake.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[sadly]</SPAN>. Is that it?

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank</SPAN>. I was determined you should know it before I went away, and there will never be a better opportunity than this. Now you know it, Nora. And now you know, too, that you can trust me as you would trust no one else.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[rises, deliberately and quietly]</SPAN>. Let me pass.

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[makes room for her to pass him, but sits still]</SPAN>. Nora!

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[at the hall door]</SPAN>. Helen, bring in the lamp. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Goes over to the stove.]</SPAN> Dear Doctor Rank, that was really horrid of you.

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank</SPAN>. To have loved you as much as anyone else does? Was that horrid?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. No, but to go and tell me so. There was really no need--

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank</SPAN>. What do you mean? Did you know--? <SPAN class="stage-direction">[MAID enters with lamp, puts it down on the table, and goes out.]</SPAN> Nora--Mrs Helmer--tell me, had you any idea of this?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Oh, how do I know whether I had or whether I hadn't? I really can't tell you--To think you could be so clumsy, Doctor Rank! We were getting on so nicely.

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank</SPAN>. Well, at all events you know now that you can command me, body and soul. So won't you speak out?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[looking at him]</SPAN>. After what happened?

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank</SPAN>. I beg you to let me know what it is.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. I can't tell you anything now.

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank</SPAN>. Yes, yes. You mustn't punish me in that way. Let me have permission to do for you whatever a man may do.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. You can do nothing for me now. Besides, I really don't need any help at all. You will find that the whole thing is merely fancy on my part. It really is so--of course it is! <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Sits down in the rocking-chair, and looks at him with a smile.]</SPAN> You are a nice sort of man, Doctor Rank!--don't you feel ashamed of yourself, now the lamp has come?

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank</SPAN>. Not a bit. But perhaps I had better go--for ever?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. No, indeed, you shall not. Of course you must come here just as before. You know very well Torvald can't do without you.

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank</SPAN>. Yes, but you?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Oh, I am always tremendously pleased when you come.

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank</SPAN>. It is just that, that put me on the wrong track. You are a riddle to me. I have often thought that you would almost as soon be in my company as in Helmer's.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Yes--you see there are some people one loves best, and others whom one would almost always rather have as companions.

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank</SPAN>. Yes, there is something in that.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. When I was at home, of course I loved papa best. But I always thought it tremendous fun if I could steal down into the maids' room, because they never moralised at all, and talked to each other about such entertaining things.

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank</SPAN>. I see--it is their place I have taken.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[jumping up and going to him]</SPAN>. Oh, dear, nice Doctor Rank, I never meant that at all. But surely you can understand that being with Torvald is a little like being with papa--<SPAN class="stage-direction">[Enter MAID from the hall.]</SPAN>

<P><SPAN class="character">Maid</SPAN>. If you please, ma'am. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Whispers and hands her a card.]</SPAN>

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[glancing at the card]</SPAN>. Oh! <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Puts it in her pocket.]</SPAN>

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank</SPAN>. Is there anything wrong?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. No, no, not in the least. It is only something--it is my new dress--

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank</SPAN>. What? Your dress is lying there.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Oh, yes, that one; but this is another. I ordered it. Torvald mustn't know about it--

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank</SPAN>. Oho! Then that was the great secret.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Of course. Just go in to him; he is sitting in the inner room. Keep him as long as--

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank</SPAN>. Make your mind easy; I won't let him escape.

<P><SPAN class="stage-direction">[Goes into HELMER'S room.]</SPAN>

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[to the MAID]</SPAN>. And he is standing waiting in the kitchen?

<P><SPAN class="character">Maid</SPAN>. Yes; he came up the back stairs.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. But didn't you tell him no one was in?

<P><SPAN class="character">Maid</SPAN>. Yes, but it was no good.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. He won't go away?

<P><SPAN class="character">Maid</SPAN>. No; he says he won't until he has seen you, ma'am.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Well, let him come in--but quietly. Helen, you mustn't say anything about it to anyone. It is a surprise for my husband.

<P><SPAN class="character">Maid</SPAN>. Yes, ma'am, I quite understand. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Exit.]</SPAN>

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. This dreadful thing is going to happen! It will happen in spite of me! No, no, no, it can't happen--it shan't happen! <SPAN class="stage-direction">[She bolts the door of HELMER'S room. The MAID opens the hall door for KROGSTAD and shuts it after him. He is wearing a fur coat, high boots and a fur cap.]</SPAN>

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[advancing towards him]</SPAN>. Speak low--my husband is at home.

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. No matter about that.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. What do you want of me?

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. An explanation of something.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Make haste then. What is it?

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. You know, I suppose, that I have got my dismissal.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. I couldn't prevent it, Mr. Krogstad. I fought as hard as I could on your side, but it was no good.

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. Does your husband love you so little, then? He knows what I can expose you to, and yet he ventures--

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. How can you suppose that he has any knowledge of the sort?

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. I didn't suppose so at all. It would not be the least like our dear Torvald Helmer to show so much courage--

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Mr. Krogstad, a little respect for my husband, please.

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. Certainly--all the respect he deserves. But since you have kept the matter so carefully to yourself, I make bold to suppose that you have a little clearer idea, than you had yesterday, of what it actually is that you have done?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. More than you could ever teach me.

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. Yes, such a bad lawyer as I am.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. What is it you want of me?

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. Only to see how you were, Mrs Helmer. I have been thinking about you all day long. A mere cashier, a quill-driver, a--well, a man like me--even he has a little of what is called feeling, you know.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Show it, then; think of my little children.

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. Have you and your husband thought of mine? But never mind about that. I only wanted to tell you that you need not take this matter too seriously. In the first place there will be no accusation made on my part.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. No, of course not; I was sure of that.

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. The whole thing can be arranged amicably; there is no reason why anyone should know anything about it. It will remain a secret between us three.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. My husband must never get to know anything about it.

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. How will you be able to prevent it? Am I to understand that you can pay the balance that is owing?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. No, not just at present.

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. Or perhaps that you have some expedient for raising the money soon?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. No expedient that I mean to make use of.

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. Well, in any case, it would have been of no use to you now. If you stood there with ever so much money in your hand, I would never part with your bond.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Tell me what purpose you mean to put it to.

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. I shall only preserve it--keep it in my possession. No one who is not concerned in the matter shall have the slightest hint of it. So that if the thought of it has driven you to any desperate resolution--

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. It has.

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. If you had it in your mind to run away from your home--

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. I had.

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. Or even something worse--

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. How could you know that?

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. Give up the idea.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. How did you know I had thought of that?

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. Most of us think of that at first. I did, too--but I hadn't the courage.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[faintly]</SPAN>. No more had I.

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[in a tone of relief]</SPAN>. No, that's it, isn't it--you hadn't the courage either?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. No, I haven't--I haven't.

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. Besides, it would have been a great piece of folly. Once the first storm at home is over--. I have a letter for your husband in my pocket.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Telling him everything?

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. In as lenient a manner as I possibly could.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[quickly]</SPAN>. He mustn't get the letter. Tear it up. I will find some means of getting money.

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. Excuse me, Mrs Helmer, but I think I told you just now--

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. I am not speaking of what I owe you. Tell me what sum you are asking my husband for, and I will get the money.

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. I am not asking your husband for a penny.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. What do you want, then?

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. I will tell you. I want to rehabilitate myself, Mrs Helmer; I want to get on; and in that your husband must help me. For the last year and a half I have not had a hand in anything dishonourable, amid all that time I have been struggling in most restricted circumstances. I was content to work my way up step by step. Now I am turned out, and I am not going to be satisfied with merely being taken into favour again. I want to get on, I tell you. I want to get into the Bank again, in a higher position. Your husband must make a place for me--

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. That he will never do!

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. He will; I know him; he dare not protest. And as soon as I am in there again with him, then you will see! Within a year I shall be the manager's right hand. It will be Nils Krogstad and not Torvald Helmer who manages the Bank.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. That's a thing you will never see!

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. Do you mean that you will--?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. I have courage enough for it now.

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. Oh, you can't frighten me. A fine, spoilt lady like you--

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. You will see, you will see.

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. Under the ice, perhaps? Down into the cold, coal-black water? And then, in the spring, to float up to the surface, all horrible and unrecognisable, with your hair fallen out--

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. You can't frighten me.

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. Nor you me. People don't do such things, Mrs Helmer. Besides, what use would it be? I should have him completely in my power all the same.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Afterwards? When I am no longer--

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. Have you forgotten that it is I who have the keeping of your reputation? <SPAN class="stage-direction">[NORA stands speechlessly looking at him.]</SPAN> Well, now, I have warned you. Do not do anything foolish. When Helmer has had my letter, I shall expect a message from him. And be sure you remember that it is your husband himself who has forced me into such ways as this again. I will never forgive him for that. Goodbye, Mrs Helmer. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Exit through the hall.]</SPAN>

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[goes to the hall door, opens it slightly and listens.]</SPAN> He is going. He is not putting the letter in the box. Oh no, no! that's impossible! <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Opens the door by degrees.]</SPAN> What is that? He is standing outside. He is not going downstairs. Is he hesitating? Can he--? <SPAN class="stage-direction">[A letter drops into the box; then KROGSTAD'S footsteps are heard, until they die away as he goes downstairs. NORA utters a stifled cry, and runs across the room to the table by the sofa. A short pause.]</SPAN>

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. In the letter-box. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Steals across to the hall door.]</SPAN> There it lies--Torvald, Torvald, there is no hope for us now!

<P><SPAN class="stage-direction">[Mrs Linde comes in from the room on the left, carrying the dress.]</SPAN>

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. There, I can't see anything more to mend now. Would you like to try it on--?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[in a hoarse whisper]</SPAN>. Christine, come here.

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN> <SPAN class="stage-direction">[throwing the dress down on the sofa]</SPAN>. What is the matter with you? You look so agitated!

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Come here. Do you see that letter? There, look--you can see it through the glass in the letter-box.

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. Yes, I see it.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. That letter is from Krogstad.

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. Nora--it was Krogstad who lent you the money!

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Yes, and now Torvald will know all about it.

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. Believe me, Nora, that's the best thing for both of you.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. You don't know all. I forged a name.

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. Good heavens--!

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. I only want to say this to you, Christine--you must be my witness.

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. Your witness? What do you mean? What am I to--?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. If I should go out of my mind--and it might easily happen--

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. Nora!

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Or if anything else should happen to me--anything, for instance, that might prevent my being here--

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. Nora! Nora! you are quite out of your mind.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. And if it should happen that there were some one who wanted to take all the responsibility, all the blame, you understand--

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. Yes, yes--but how can you suppose--?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Then you must be my witness, that it is not true, Christine. I am not out of my mind at all; I am in my right senses now, and I tell you no one else has known anything about it; I, and I alone, did the whole thing. Remember that.

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. I will, indeed. But I don't understand all this.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. How should you understand it? A wonderful thing is going to happen!

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. A wonderful thing?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Yes, a wonderful thing!--But it is so terrible, Christine; it mustn't happen, not for all the world.

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. I will go at once and see Krogstad.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Don't go to him; he will do you some harm.

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. There was a time when he would gladly do anything for my sake.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. He?

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. Where does he live?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. How should I know--? Yes <SPAN class="stage-direction">[feeling in her pocket]</SPAN>, here is his card. But the letter, the letter--!

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[calls from his room, knocking at the door]</SPAN>. Nora! Nora <SPAN class="stage-direction">[cries out anxiously]</SPAN>. Oh, what's that? What do you want?

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Don't be so frightened. We are not coming in; you have locked the door. Are you trying on your dress?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Yes, that's it. I look so nice, Torvald.

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN> <SPAN class="stage-direction">[who has read the card]</SPAN>. I see he lives at the corner here.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Yes, but it's no use. It is hopeless. The letter is lying there in the box.

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. And your husband keeps the key?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Yes, always.

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. Krogstad must ask for his letter back unread, he must find some pretence--

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. But it is just at this time that Torvald generally--

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. You must delay him. Go in to him in the meantime. I will come back as soon as I can. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[She goes out hurriedly through the hall door.]</SPAN>

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[goes to HELMER'S door, opens it and peeps in]</SPAN>. Torvald!

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[from the inner room]</SPAN>. Well? May I venture at last to come into my own room again? Come along, Rank, now you will see-- <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Halting in the doorway.]</SPAN> But what is this?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. What is what, dear?

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Rank led me to expect a splendid transformation.

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[in the doorway]</SPAN>. I understood so, but evidently I was mistaken.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Yes, nobody is to have the chance of admiring me in my dress until tomorrow.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. But, my dear Nora, you look so worn out. Have you been practising too much?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. No, I have not practised at all.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. But you will need to--

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Yes, indeed I shall, Torvald. But I can't get on a bit without you to help me; I have absolutely forgotten the whole thing.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Oh, we will soon work it up again.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Yes, help me, Torvald. Promise that you will! I am so nervous about it--all the people--. You must give yourself up to me entirely this evening. Not the tiniest bit of business--you mustn't even take a pen in your hand. Will you promise, Torvald dear?

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. I promise. This evening I will be wholly and absolutely at your service, you helpless little mortal. Ah, by the way, first of all I will just-- <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Goes towards the hall door.]</SPAN>

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. What are you going to do there?

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Only see if any letters have come.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. No, no! don't do that, Torvald!

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Why not?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Torvald, please don't. There is nothing there.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Well, let me look. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Turns to go to the letter-box. NORA, at the piano, plays the first bars of the Tarantella. HELMER stops in the doorway.]</SPAN> Aha!

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. I can't dance tomorrow if I don't practise with you.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[going up to her]</SPAN>. Are you really so afraid of it, dear?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Yes, so dreadfully afraid of it. Let me practise at once; there is time now, before we go to dinner. Sit down and play for me, Torvald dear; criticise me, and correct me as you play.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. With great pleasure, if you wish me to. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Sits down at the piano.]</SPAN>

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[takes out of the box a tambourine and a long variegated shawl. She hastily drapes the shawl round her. Then she springs to the front of the stage and calls out]</SPAN>. Now play for me! I am going to dance!

<P><SPAN class="stage-direction">[HELMER plays and NORA dances. RANK stands by the piano behind HELMER, and looks on.]</SPAN>

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[as he plays]</SPAN>. Slower, slower!

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. I can't do it any other way.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Not so violently, Nora!

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. This is the way.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[stops playing]</SPAN>. No, no--that is not a bit right.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[laughing and swinging the tambourine]</SPAN>. Didn't I tell you so?

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank</SPAN>. Let me play for her.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[getting up]</SPAN>. Yes, do. I can correct her better then.

<P><SPAN class="stage-direction">[RANK sits down at the piano and plays. NORA dances more and more wildly.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[as she dances]</SPAN>. Such fun, Christine!

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. My dear darling Nora, you are dancing as if your life depended on it.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. So it does.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Stop, Rank; this is sheer madness. Stop, I tell you! <SPAN class="stage-direction">[RANK stops playing, and NORA suddenly stands still. HELMER goes up to her.]</SPAN> I could never have believed it. You have forgotten everything I taught you.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[throwing away the tambourine]</SPAN>. There, you see.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. You will want a lot of coaching.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Yes, you see how much I need it. You must coach me up to the last minute. Promise me that, Torvald!

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. You can depend on me.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. You must not think of anything but me, either today or tomorrow; you mustn't open a single letter--not even open the letter-box--

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Ah, you are still afraid of that fellow--

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Yes, indeed I am.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Nora, I can tell from your looks that there is a letter from him lying there.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. I don't know; I think there is; but you must not read anything of that kind now. Nothing horrid must come between us until this is all over.

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[whispers to HELMER]</SPAN>. You mustn't contradict her.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[taking her in his arms]</SPAN>. The child shall have her way. But tomorrow night, after you have danced--

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Then you will be free. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[The MAID appears in the doorway to the right.]</SPAN>

<P><SPAN class="character">Maid</SPAN>. Dinner is served, ma'am.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. We will have champagne, Helen.

<P><SPAN class="character">Maid</SPAN>. Very good, ma'am.        [Exit.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Hullo!--are we going to have a banquet?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Yes, a champagne banquet until the small hours. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Calls out.]</SPAN> And a few macaroons, Helen--lots, just for once!

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Come, come, don't be so wild and nervous. Be my own little skylark, as you used.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Yes, dear, I will. But go in now and you too, Doctor Rank. Christine, you must help me to do up my hair.

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[whispers to HELMER as they go out]</SPAN>. I suppose there is nothing--she is not expecting anything?

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Far from it, my dear fellow; it is simply nothing more than this childish nervousness I was telling you of. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[They go into the right-hand room.]</SPAN>

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Well!

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. Gone out of town.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. I could tell from your face.

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. He is coming home tomorrow evening. I wrote a note for him.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. You should have let it alone; you must prevent nothing. After all, it is splendid to be waiting for a wonderful thing to happen.

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. What is it that you are waiting for?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Oh, you wouldn't understand. Go in to them, I will come in a moment. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Mrs Linde goes into the dining-room. NORA stands still for a little while, as if to compose herself. Then she looks at her watch.]</SPAN> Five o'clock. Seven hours until midnight; and then four-and-twenty hours until the next midnight. Then the Tarantella will be over. Twenty-four and seven? Thirty-one hours to live.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[from the doorway on the right]</SPAN>. Where's my little skylark?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[going to him with her arms outstretched]</SPAN>. Here she is!

<HR>

<H3>ACT III</H3>

<P><SPAN class="stage-direction">[THE SAME SCENE.--The table has been placed in the middle of the stage, with chairs around it. A lamp is burning on the table. The door into the hall stands open. Dance music is heard in the room above. Mrs Linde is sitting at the table idly turning over the leaves of a book; she tries to read, but does not seem able to collect her thoughts. Every now and then she listens intently for a sound at the outer door.]</SPAN>

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN> <SPAN class="stage-direction">[looking at her watch]</SPAN>. Not yet--and the time is nearly up. If only he does not--. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Listens again.]</SPAN> Ah, there he is. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Goes into the hall and opens the outer door carefully. Light footsteps are heard on the stairs. She whispers.]</SPAN> Come in. There is no one here.

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[in the doorway]</SPAN>. I found a note from you at home. What does this mean?

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. It is absolutely necessary that I should have a talk with you.

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. Really? And is it absolutely necessary that it should be here?

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. It is impossible where I live; there is no private entrance to my rooms. Come in; we are quite alone. The maid is asleep, and the Helmers are at the dance upstairs.

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[coming into the room]</SPAN>. Are the Helmers really at a dance tonight?

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. Yes, why not?

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. Certainly--why not?

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. Now, Nils, let us have a talk.

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. Can we two have anything to talk about?

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. We have a great deal to talk about.

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. I shouldn't have thought so.

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. No, you have never properly understood me.

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. Was there anything else to understand except what was obvious to all the world--a heartless woman jilts a man when a more lucrative chance turns up?

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. Do you believe I am as absolutely heartless as all that? And do you believe that I did it with a light heart?

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. Didn't you?

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. Nils, did you really think that?

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. If it were as you say, why did you write to me as you did at the time?

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. I could do nothing else. As I had to break with you, it was my duty also to put an end to all that you felt for me.

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[wringing his hands]</SPAN>. So that was it. And all this--only for the sake of money!

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. You must not forget that I had a helpless mother and two little brothers. We couldn't wait for you, Nils; your prospects seemed hopeless then.

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. That may be so, but you had no right to throw me over for anyone else's sake.

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. Indeed I don't know. Many a time did I ask myself if I had the right to do it.

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[more gently]</SPAN>. When I lost you, it was as if all the solid ground went from under my feet. Look at me now--I am a shipwrecked man clinging to a bit of wreckage.

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. But help may be near.

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. It was near; but then you came and stood in my way.

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. Unintentionally, Nils. It was only today that I learned it was your place I was going to take in the Bank.

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. I believe you, if you say so. But now that you know it, are you not going to give it up to me?

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. No, because that would not benefit you in the least.

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. Oh, benefit, benefit--I would have done it whether or no.

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. I have learned to act prudently. Life, and hard, bitter necessity have taught me that.

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. And life has taught me not to believe in fine speeches.

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. Then life has taught you something very reasonable. But deeds you must believe in?

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. What do you mean by that?

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. You said you were like a shipwrecked man clinging to some wreckage.

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. I had good reason to say so.

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. Well, I am like a shipwrecked woman clinging to some wreckage--no one to mourn for, no one to care for.

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. It was your own choice.

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. There was no other choice--then.

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. Well, what now?

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. Nils, how would it be if we two shipwrecked people could join forces?

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. What are you saying?

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. Two on the same piece of wreckage would stand a better chance than each on their own.

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. Christine I...

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. What do you suppose brought me to town?

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. Do you mean that you gave me a thought?

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. I could not endure life without work. All my life, as long as I can remember, I have worked, and it has been my greatest and only pleasure. But now I am quite alone in the world--my life is so dreadfully empty and I feel so forsaken. There is not the least pleasure in working for one's self. Nils, give me someone and something to work for.

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. I don't trust that. It is nothing but a woman's overstrained sense of generosity that prompts you to make such an offer of yourself.

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. Have you ever noticed anything of the sort in me?

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. Could you really do it? Tell me--do you know all about my past life?

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. Yes.

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. And do you know what they think of me here?

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. You seemed to me to imply that with me you might have been quite another man.

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. I am certain of it.

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. Is it too late now?

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. Christine, are you saying this deliberately? Yes, I am sure you are. I see it in your face. Have you really the courage, then--?

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. I want to be a mother to someone, and your children need a mother. We two need each other. Nils, I have faith in your real character--I can dare anything together with you.

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[grasps her hands]</SPAN>. Thanks, thanks, Christine! Now I shall find a way to clear myself in the eyes of the world. Ah, but I forgot--

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN> <SPAN class="stage-direction">[listening]</SPAN>. Hush! The Tarantella! Go, go!

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. Why? What is it?

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. Do you hear them up there? When that is over, we may expect them back.

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. Yes, yes--I will go. But it is all no use. Of course you are not aware what steps I have taken in the matter of the Helmers.

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. Yes, I know all about that.

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. And in spite of that have you the courage to--?

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. I understand very well to what lengths a man like you might be driven by despair.

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. If I could only undo what I have done!

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. You cannot. Your letter is lying in the letter-box now.

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. Are you sure of that?

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. Quite sure, but--

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[with a searching look at her]</SPAN>. Is that what it all means?--that you want to save your friend at any cost? Tell me frankly. Is that it?

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. Nils, a woman who has once sold herself for another's sake, doesn't do it a second time.

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. I will ask for my letter back.

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. No, no.

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. Yes, of course I will. I will wait here until Helmer comes; I will tell him he must give me my letter back--that it only concerns my dismissal--that he is not to read it--

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. No, Nils, you must not recall your letter.

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. But, tell me, wasn't it for that very purpose that you asked me to meet you here?

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. In my first moment of fright, it was. But twenty-four hours have elapsed since then, and in that time I have witnessed incredible things in this house. Helmer must know all about it. This unhappy secret must be disclosed; they must have a complete understanding between them, which is impossible with all this concealment and falsehood going on.

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. Very well, if you will take the responsibility. But there is one thing I can do in any case, and I shall do it at once.

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN> <SPAN class="stage-direction">[listening]</SPAN>. You must be quick and go! The dance is over; we are not safe a moment longer.

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. I will wait for you below.

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. Yes, do. You must see me back to my door...

<P><SPAN class="character">Krogstad</SPAN>. I have never had such an amazing piece of good fortune in my life! <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Goes out through the outer door. The door between the room and the hall remains open.]</SPAN>

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN> <SPAN class="stage-direction">[tidying up the room and laying her hat and cloak ready]</SPAN>. What a difference! what a difference! Someone to work for and live for--a home to bring comfort into. That I will do, indeed. I wish they would be quick and come--<SPAN class="stage-direction">[Listens.]</SPAN> Ah, there they are now. I must put on my things. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Takes up her hat and cloak. HELMER'S and NORA'S voices are heard outside; a key is turned, and HELMER brings NORA almost by force into the hall. She is in an Italian costume with a large black shawl around her; he is in evening dress, and a black domino which is flying open.]</SPAN>

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[hanging back in the doorway, and struggling with him]</SPAN>. No, no, no!--don't take me in. I want to go upstairs again; I don't want to leave so early.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. But, my dearest Nora--

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Please, Torvald dear--please, please--only an hour more.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Not a single minute, my sweet Nora. You know that was our agreement. Come along into the room; you are catching cold standing there. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[He brings her gently into the room, in spite of her resistance.]</SPAN>

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. Good evening.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Christine!

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. You here, so late, Mrs Linde?

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. Yes, you must excuse me; I was so anxious to see Nora in her dress.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Have you been sitting here waiting for me?

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. Yes, unfortunately I came too late, you had already gone upstairs; and I thought I couldn't go away again without having seen you.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[taking off NORA'S shawl]</SPAN>. Yes, take a good look at her. I think she is worth looking at. Isn't she charming, Mrs Linde?

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. Yes, indeed she is.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Doesn't she look remarkably pretty? Everyone thought so at the dance. But she is terribly self-willed, this sweet little person. What are we to do with her? You will hardly believe that I had almost to bring her away by force.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Torvald, you will repent not having let me stay, even if it were only for half an hour.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Listen to her, Mrs Linde! She had danced her Tarantella, and it had been a tremendous success, as it deserved--although possibly the performance was a trifle too realistic--a little more so, I mean, than was strictly compatible with the limitations of art. But never mind about that! The chief thing is, she had made a success--she had made a tremendous success. Do you think I was going to let her remain there after that, and spoil the effect? No, indeed! I took my charming little Capri maiden--my capricious little Capri maiden, I should say--on my arm; took one quick turn round the room; a curtsey on either side, and, as they say in novels, the beautiful apparition disappeared. An exit ought always to be effective, Mrs Linde; but that is what I cannot make Nora understand. Pooh! this room is hot. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Throws his domino on a chair, and opens the door of his room.]</SPAN> Hullo! it's all dark in here. Oh, of course--excuse me--. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[He goes in, and lights some candles.]</SPAN>

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[in a hurried and breathless whisper]</SPAN>. Well?

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN> <SPAN class="stage-direction">[in a low voice]</SPAN>. I have had a talk with him.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Yes, and--

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. Nora, you must tell your husband all about it.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[in an expressionless voice]</SPAN>. I knew it.

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. You have nothing to be afraid of as far as Krogstad is concerned; but you must tell him.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. I won't tell him.

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. Then the letter will.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Thank you, Christine. Now I know what I must do. Hush--!

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[coming in again]</SPAN>. Well, Mrs Linde, have you admired her?

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. Yes, and now I will say goodnight.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. What, already? Is this yours, this knitting?

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN> <SPAN class="stage-direction">[taking it]</SPAN>. Yes, thank you, I had very nearly forgotten it.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. So you knit?

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. Of course.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Do you know, you ought to embroider.

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. Really? Why?

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Yes, it's far more becoming. Let me show you. You hold the embroidery thus in your left hand, and use the needle with the right--like this--with a long, easy sweep. Do you see?

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. Yes, perhaps--

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. But in the case of knitting--that can never be anything but ungraceful; look here--the arms close together, the knitting- needles going up and down--it has a sort of Chinese effect--. That was really excellent champagne they gave us.

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. Well,--goodnight, Nora, and don't be self-willed any more.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. That's right, Mrs Linde.

<P><SPAN class="character">Mrs Linde</SPAN>. Goodnight, Mr. Helmer.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[accompanying her to the door]</SPAN>. Goodnight, goodnight. I hope you will get home all right. I should be very happy to--but you haven't any great distance to go. Goodnight, goodnight. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[She goes out; he shuts the door after her, and comes in again.]</SPAN> Ah!--at last we have got rid of her. She is a frightful bore, that woman.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Aren't you very tired, Torvald?

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. No, not in the least.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Nor sleepy?

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Not a bit. On the contrary, I feel extraordinarily lively. And you?--you really look both tired and sleepy.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Yes, I am very tired. I want to go to sleep at once.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. There, you see it was quite right of me not to let you stay there any longer.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Everything you do is quite right, Torvald.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[kissing her on the forehead]</SPAN>. Now my little skylark is speaking reasonably. Did you notice what good spirits Rank was in this evening?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Really? Was he? I didn't speak to him at all.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. And I very little, but I have not for a long time seen him in such good form. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Looks for a while at her and then goes nearer to her.]</SPAN> It is delightful to be at home by ourselves again, to be all alone with you--you fascinating, charming little darling!

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Don't look at me like that, Torvald.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Why shouldn't I look at my dearest treasure?--at all the beauty that is mine, all my very own?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[going to the other side of the table]</SPAN>. You mustn't say things like that to me tonight.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[following her]</SPAN>. You have still got the Tarantella in your blood, I see. And it makes you more captivating than ever. Listen--the guests are beginning to go now. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[In a lower voice.]</SPAN> Nora--soon the whole house will be quiet.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Yes, I hope so.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Yes, my own darling Nora. Do you know, when I am out at a party with you like this, why I speak so little to you, keep away from you, and only send a stolen glance in your direction now and then?--do you know why I do that? It is because I make believe to myself that we are secretly in love, and you are my secretly promised bride, and that no one suspects there is anything between us.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Yes, yes--I know very well your thoughts are with me all the time.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. And when we are leaving, and I am putting the shawl over your beautiful young shoulders--on your lovely neck--then I imagine that you are my young bride and that we have just come from the wedding, and I am bringing you for the first time into our home--to be alone with you for the first time--quite alone with my shy little darling! All this evening I have longed for nothing but you. When I watched the seductive figures of the Tarantella, my blood was on fire; I could endure it no longer, and that was why I brought you down so early--

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Go away, Torvald! You must let me go. I won't--

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. What's that? You're joking, my little Nora! You won't-- you won't? Am I not your husband--? <SPAN class="stage-direction">[A knock is heard at the outer door.]</SPAN>

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[starting]</SPAN>. Did you hear--?

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[going into the hall]</SPAN>. Who is it?

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[outside]</SPAN>. It is I. May I come in for a moment?

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[in a fretful whisper]</SPAN>. Oh, what does he want now? <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Aloud.]</SPAN> Wait a minute! <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Unlocks the door.]</SPAN> Come, that's kind of you not to pass by our door.

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank</SPAN>. I thought I heard your voice, and felt as if I should like to look in. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[With a swift glance round.]</SPAN> Ah, yes!--these dear familiar rooms. You are very happy and cosy in here, you two.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. It seems to me that you looked after yourself pretty well upstairs too.

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank</SPAN>. Excellently. Why shouldn't I? Why shouldn't one enjoy everything in this world?--at any rate as much as one can, and as long as one can. The wine was capital--

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Especially the champagne.

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank</SPAN>. So you noticed that too? It is almost incredible how much I managed to put away!

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Torvald drank a great deal of champagne tonight too.

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank</SPAN>. Did he?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Yes, and he is always in such good spirits afterwards.

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank</SPAN>. Well, why should one not enjoy a merry evening after a well-spent day?

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Well spent? I am afraid I can't take credit for that.

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[clapping him on the back]</SPAN>. But I can, you know!

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Doctor Rank, you must have been occupied with some scientific investigation today.

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank</SPAN>. Exactly.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Just listen!--little Nora talking about scientific investigations!

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. And may I congratulate you on the result?

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank</SPAN>. Indeed you may.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Was it favourable, then?

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank</SPAN>. The best possible, for both doctor and patient--certainty.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[quickly and searchingly]</SPAN>. Certainty?

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank</SPAN>. Absolute certainty. So wasn't I entitled to make a merry evening of it after that?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Yes, you certainly were, Doctor Rank.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. I think so too, so long as you don't have to pay for it in the morning.

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank</SPAN>. Oh well, one can't have anything in this life without paying for it.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Doctor Rank--are you fond of fancy-dress balls?

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank</SPAN>. Yes, if there is a fine lot of pretty costumes.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Tell me--what shall we two wear at the next?

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Little featherbrain!--are you thinking of the next already?

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank</SPAN>. We two? Yes, I can tell you. You shall go as a good fairy--

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Yes, but what do you suggest as an appropriate costume for that?

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank</SPAN>. Let your wife go dressed just as she is in everyday life.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. That was really very prettily turned. But can't you tell us what you will be?

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank</SPAN>. Yes, my dear friend, I have quite made up my mind about that.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Well?

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank</SPAN>. At the next fancy-dress ball I shall be invisible.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. That's a good joke!

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank</SPAN>. There is a big black hat--have you never heard of hats that make you invisible? If you put one on, no one can see you.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[suppressing a smile]</SPAN>. Yes, you are quite right.

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank</SPAN>. But I am clean forgetting what I came for. Helmer, give me a cigar--one of the dark Havanas.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. With the greatest pleasure. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Offers him his case.]</SPAN>

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[takes a cigar and cuts off the end]</SPAN>. Thanks.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[striking a match]</SPAN>. Let me give you a light.

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank</SPAN>. Thank you. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[She holds the match for him to light his cigar.]</SPAN> And now goodbye!

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Goodbye, goodbye, dear old man!

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Sleep well, Doctor Rank.

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank</SPAN>. Thank you for that wish.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Wish me the same.

<P><SPAN class="character">Rank</SPAN>. You? Well, if you want me to sleep well! And thanks for the light. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[He nods to them both and goes out.]</SPAN>

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[in a subdued voice]</SPAN>. He has drunk more than he ought.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[absently]</SPAN>. Maybe. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[HELMER takes a bunch of keys out of his pocket and goes into the hall.]</SPAN> Torvald! what are you going to do there?

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Emptying the letter-box; it is quite full; there will be no room to put the newspaper in tomorrow morning.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Are you going to work tonight?

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. You know quite well I'm not. What is this? Someone has been at the lock.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. At the lock--?

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Yes, someone has. What can it mean? I should never have thought the maid--. Here is a broken hairpin. Nora, it is one of yours.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[quickly]</SPAN>. Then it must have been the children--

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Then you must get them out of those ways. There, at last I have got it open. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Takes out the contents of the letter-box, and calls to the kitchen.]</SPAN> Helen!--Helen, put out the light over the front door. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Goes back into the room and shuts the door into the hall. He holds out his hand full of letters.]</SPAN> Look at that-- look what a heap of them there are. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Turning them over.]</SPAN> What on earth is that?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[at the window]</SPAN>. The letter--No! Torvald, no!

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Two cards--of Rank's.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Of Doctor Rank's?

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[looking at them]</SPAN>. Doctor Rank. They were on the top. He must have put them in when he went out.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Is there anything written on them?

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. There is a black cross over the name. Look there--what an uncomfortable idea! It looks as if he were announcing his own death.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. It is just what he is doing.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. What? Do you know anything about it? Has he said anything to you?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Yes. He told me that when the cards came it would be his leave-taking from us. He means to shut himself up and die.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. My poor old friend! Certainly I knew we should not have him very long with us. But so soon! And so he hides himself away like a wounded animal.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. If it has to happen, it is best it should be without a word--don't you think so, Torvald?

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[walking up and down]</SPAN>. He had so grown into our lives. I can't think of him as having gone out of them. He, with his sufferings and his loneliness, was like a cloudy background to our sunlit happiness. Well, perhaps it is best so. For him, anyway. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Standing still.]</SPAN> And perhaps for us too, Nora. We two are thrown quite upon each other now. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Puts his arms round her.]</SPAN> My darling wife, I don't feel as if I could hold you tight enough. Do you know, Nora, I have often wished that you might be threatened by some great danger, so that I might risk my life's blood, and everything, for your sake.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[disengages herself, and says firmly and decidedly]</SPAN>. Now you must read your letters, Torvald.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. No, no; not tonight. I want to be with you, my darling wife.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. With the thought of your friend's death--

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. You are right, it has affected us both. Something ugly has come between us--the thought of the horrors of death. We must try and rid our minds of that. Until then--we will each go to our own room.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[hanging on his neck]</SPAN>. Goodnight, Torvald--Goodnight!

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[kissing her on the forehead]</SPAN>. Goodnight, my little singing-bird. Sleep sound, Nora. Now I will read my letters through. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[He takes his letters and goes into his room, shutting the door after him.]</SPAN>

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[gropes distractedly about, seizes HELMER'S domino, throws it round her, while she says in quick, hoarse, spasmodic whispers]</SPAN>. Never to see him again. Never! Never! <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Puts her shawl over her head.]</SPAN> Never to see my children again either--never again. Never! Never!--Ah! the icy, black water--the unfathomable depths--If only it were over! He has got it now--now he is reading it. Goodbye, Torvald and my children! <SPAN class="stage-direction">[She is about to rush out through the hall, when HELMER opens his door hurriedly and stands with an open letter in his hand.]</SPAN>

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Nora!

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Ah!--

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. What is this? Do you know what is in this letter?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Yes, I know. Let me go! Let me get out!

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[holding her back]</SPAN>. Where are you going?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[trying to get free]</SPAN>. You shan't save me, Torvald!

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[reeling]</SPAN>. True? Is this true, that I read here? Horrible! No, no--it is impossible that it can be true.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. It is true. I have loved you above everything else in the world.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Oh, don't let us have any silly excuses.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[taking a step towards him]</SPAN>. Torvald--!

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Miserable creature--what have you done?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Let me go. You shall not suffer for my sake. You shall not take it upon yourself.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. No tragic airs, please. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Locks the hall door.]</SPAN> Here you shall stay and give me an explanation. Do you understand what you have done? Answer me! Do you understand what you have done?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[looks steadily at him and says with a growing look of coldness in her face]</SPAN>. Yes, now I am beginning to understand thoroughly.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[walking about the room]</SPAN>. What a horrible awakening! All these eight years--she who was my joy and pride--a hypocrite, a liar--worse, worse--a criminal! The unutterable ugliness of it all!--For shame! For shame! <SPAN class="stage-direction">[NORA is silent and looks steadily at him. He stops in front of her.]</SPAN> I ought to have suspected that something of the sort would happen. I ought to have foreseen it. All your father's want of principle--be silent!--all your father's want of principle has come out in you. No religion, no morality, no sense of duty--. How I am punished for having winked at what he did! I did it for your sake, and this is how you repay me.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Yes, that's just it.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Now you have destroyed all my happiness. You have ruined all my future. It is horrible to think of! I am in the power of an unscrupulous man; he can do what he likes with me, ask anything he likes of me, give me any orders he pleases--I dare not refuse. And I must sink to such miserable depths because of a thoughtless woman!

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. When I am out of the way, you will be free.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. No fine speeches, please. Your father had always plenty of those ready, too. What good would it be to me if you were out of the way, as you say? Not the slightest. He can make the affair known everywhere; and if he does, I may be falsely suspected of having been a party to your criminal action. Very likely people will think I was behind it all--that it was I who prompted you! And I have to thank you for all this--you whom I have cherished during the whole of our married life. Do you understand now what it is you have done for me?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[coldly and quietly]</SPAN>. Yes.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. It is so incredible that I can't take it in. But we must come to some understanding. Take off that shawl. Take it off, I tell you. I must try and appease him some way or another. The matter must be hushed up at any cost. And as for you and me, it must appear as if everything between us were just as before--but naturally only in the eyes of the world. You will still remain in my house, that is a matter of course. But I shall not allow you to bring up the children; I dare not trust them to you. To think that I should be obliged to say so to one whom I have loved so dearly, and whom I still--. No, that is all over. From this moment happiness is not the question; all that concerns us is to save the remains, the fragments, the appearance--

<P><SPAN class="stage-direction">[A ring is heard at the front-door bell.]</SPAN>

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[with a start]</SPAN>. What is that? So late! Can the worst--? Can he--? Hide yourself, Nora. Say you are ill.

<P><SPAN class="stage-direction">[NORA stands motionless. HELMER goes and unlocks the hall door.]</SPAN>

<P><SPAN class="character">Maid </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[half-dressed, comes to the door]</SPAN>. A letter for the mistress.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Give it to me. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Takes the letter, and shuts the door.]</SPAN> Yes, it is from him. You shall not have it; I will read it myself.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Yes, read it.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[standing by the lamp]</SPAN>. I scarcely have the courage to do it. It may mean ruin for both of us. No, I must know. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Tears open the letter, runs his eye over a few lines, looks at a paper enclosed, and gives a shout of joy.]</SPAN> Nora! <SPAN class="stage-direction">[She looks at him questioningly.]</SPAN> Nora!--No, I must read it once again--. Yes, it is true! I am saved! Nora, I am saved!

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. And I?

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. You too, of course; we are both saved, both you and I. Look, he sends you your bond back. He says he regrets and repents-- that a happy change in his life--never mind what he says! We are saved, Nora! No one can do anything to you. Oh, Nora, Nora!--no, first I must destroy these hateful things. Let me see--. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Takes a look at the bond.]</SPAN> No, no, I won't look at it. The whole thing shall be nothing but a bad dream to me. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Tears up the bond and both letters, throws them all into the stove, and watches them burn.]</SPAN> There--now it doesn't exist any longer. He says that since Christmas Eve you--. These must have been three dreadful days for you, Nora.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. I have fought a hard fight these three days.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. And suffered agonies, and seen no way out but--. No, we won't call any of the horrors to mind. We will only shout with joy, and keep saying, "It's all over! It's all over!" Listen to me, Nora. You don't seem to realise that it is all over. What is this?--such a cold, set face! My poor little Nora, I quite understand; you don't feel as if you could believe that I have forgiven you. But it is true, Nora, I swear it; I have forgiven you everything. I know that what you did, you did out of love for me.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. That is true.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. You have loved me as a wife ought to love her husband. Only you had not sufficient knowledge to judge of the means you used. But do you suppose you are any the less dear to me, because you don't understand how to act on your own responsibility? No, no; only lean on me; I will advise you and direct you. I should not be a man if this womanly helplessness did not just give you a double attractiveness in my eyes. You must not think anymore about the hard things I said in my first moment of consternation, when I thought everything was going to overwhelm me. I have forgiven you, Nora; I swear to you I have forgiven you.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Thank you for your forgiveness. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[She goes out through the door to the right.]</SPAN>

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. No, don't go--. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Looks in.]</SPAN> What are you doing in there?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[from within]</SPAN>. Taking off my fancy dress.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[standing at the open door]</SPAN>. Yes, do. Try and calm yourself, and make your mind easy again, my frightened little singing-bird. Be at rest, and feel secure; I have broad wings to shelter you under. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Walks up and down by the door.]</SPAN> How warm and cosy our home is, Nora. Here is shelter for you; here I will protect you like a hunted dove that I have saved from a hawk's claws; I will bring peace to your poor beating heart. It will come, little by little, Nora, believe me. Tomorrow morning you will look upon it all quite differently; soon everything will be just as it was before. Very soon you won't need me to assure you that I have forgiven you; you will yourself feel the certainty that I have done so. Can you suppose I should ever think of such a thing as repudiating you, or even reproaching you? You have no idea what a true man's heart is like, Nora. There is something so indescribably sweet and satisfying, to a man, in the knowledge that he has forgiven his wife--forgiven her freely, and with all his heart. It seems as if that had made her, as it were, doubly his own; he has given her a new life, so to speak; and she has in a way become both wife and child to him. So you shall be for me after this, my little scared, helpless darling. Have no anxiety about anything, Nora; only be frank and open with me, and I will serve as will and conscience both to you--. What is this? Not gone to bed? Have you changed your things?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[in everyday dress]</SPAN>. Yes, Torvald, I have changed my things now.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. But what for?--so late as this.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. I shall not sleep tonight.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. But, my dear Nora--

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[looking at her watch]</SPAN>. It is not so very late. Sit down here, Torvald. You and I have much to say to one another. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[She sits down at one side of the table.]</SPAN>

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Nora--what is this?--this cold, set face?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Sit down.  It will take some time; I have a lot to talk over with you.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[sits down at the opposite side of the table]</SPAN>. You alarm me, Nora!--and I don't understand you.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. No, that is just it. You don't understand me, and I have never understood you either--before tonight. No, you mustn't interrupt me. You must simply listen to what I say. Torvald, this is a settling of accounts.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. What do you mean by that?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[after a short silence]</SPAN>. Isn't there one thing that strikes you as strange in our sitting here like this?

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. What is that?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. We have been married now eight years. Does it not occur to you that this is the first time we two, you and I, husband and wife, have had a serious conversation?

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. What do you mean by serious?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. In all these eight years--longer than that--from the very beginning of our acquaintance, we have never exchanged a word on any serious subject.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Was it likely that I would be continually and forever telling you about worries that you could not help me to bear?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. I am not speaking about business matters. I say that we have never sat down in earnest together to try and get at the bottom of anything.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. But, dearest Nora, would it have been any good to you?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. That is just it; you have never understood me. I have been greatly wronged, Torvald--first by papa and then by you.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. What! By us two--by us two, who have loved you better than anyone else in the world?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[shaking her head]</SPAN>. You have never loved me. You have only thought it pleasant to be in love with me.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Nora, what do I hear you saying?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. It is perfectly true, Torvald. When I was at home with papa, he told me his opinion about everything, and so I had the same opinions; and if I differed from him I concealed the fact, because he would not have liked it. He called me his doll-child, and he played with me just as I used to play with my dolls. And when I came to live with you--

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. What sort of an expression is that to use about our marriage?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[undisturbed]</SPAN>. I mean that I was simply transferred from papa's hands into yours. You arranged everything according to your own taste, and so I got the same tastes as your else I pretended to, I am really not quite sure which--I think sometimes the one and sometimes the other. When I look back on it, it seems to me as if I had been living here like a poor woman--just from hand to mouth. I have existed merely to perform tricks for you, Torvald. But you would have it so. You and papa have committed a great sin against me. It is your fault that I have made nothing of my life.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. How unreasonable and how ungrateful you are, Nora! Have you not been happy here?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. No, I have never been happy. I thought I was, but it has never really been so.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Not--not happy!

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. No, only merry. And you have always been so kind to me. But our home has been nothing but a playroom. I have been your doll-wife, just as at home I was papa's doll-child; and here the children have been my dolls. I thought it great fun when you played with me, just as they thought it great fun when I played with them. That is what our marriage has been, Torvald.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. There is some truth in what you say--exaggerated and strained as your view of it is. But for the future it shall be different. Playtime shall be over, and lesson-time shall begin.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Whose lessons? Mine, or the children's?

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Both yours and the children's, my darling Nora.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Alas, Torvald, you are not the man to educate me into being a proper wife for you.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. And you can say that!

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. And I--how am I fitted to bring up the children?

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Nora!

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Didn't you say so yourself a little while ago--that you dare not trust me to bring them up?

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. In a moment of anger! Why do you pay any heed to that?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Indeed, you were perfectly right. I am not fit for the task. There is another task I must undertake first. I must try and educate myself--you are not the man to help me in that. I must do that for myself. And that is why I am going to leave you now.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[springing up]</SPAN>. What do you say?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. I must stand quite alone, if I am to understand myself and everything about me. It is for that reason that I cannot remain with you any longer.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Nora, Nora!

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. I am going away from here now, at once. I am sure Christine will take me in for the night--

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. You are out of your mind! I won't allow it! I forbid you!

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. It is no use forbidding me anything any longer. I will take with me what belongs to myself. I will take nothing from you, either now or later.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. What sort of madness is this!

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Tomorrow I shall go home--I mean, to my old home. It will be easiest for me to find something to do there.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. You blind, foolish woman!

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. I must try and get some sense, Torvald.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. To desert your home, your husband and your children! And you don't consider what people will say!

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. I cannot consider that at all. I only know that it is necessary for me.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. It's shocking. This is how you would neglect your most sacred duties.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. What do you consider my most sacred duties?

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Do I need to tell you that? Are they not your duties to your husband and your children?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. I have other duties just as sacred.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. That you have not. What duties could those be?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Duties to myself.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Before all else, you are a wife and a mother.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. I don't believe that any longer. I believe that before all else I am a reasonable human being, just as you are--or, at all events, that I must try and become one. I know quite well, Torvald, that most people would think you right, and that views of that kind are to be found in books; but I can no longer content myself with what most people say, or with what is found in books. I must think over things for myself and get to understand them.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Can you not understand your place in your own home? Have you not a reliable guide in such matters as that?--have you no religion?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. I am afraid, Torvald, I do not exactly know what religion is.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. What are you saying?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. I know nothing but what the clergyman said, when I went to be confirmed. He told us that religion was this, and that, and the other. When I am away from all this, and am alone, I will look into that matter too. I will see if what the clergyman said is true, or at all events if it is true for me.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. This is unheard of in a girl of your age! But if religion cannot lead you aright, let me try and awaken your conscience. I suppose you have some moral sense? Or--answer me--am I to think you have none?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. I assure you, Torvald, that is not an easy question to answer. I really don't know. The thing perplexes me altogether. I only know that you and I look at it in quite a different light. I am learning, too, that the law is quite another thing from what I supposed; but I find it impossible to convince myself that the law is right. According to it a woman has no right to spare her old dying father, or to save her husband's life. I can't believe that.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. You talk like a child. You don't understand the conditions of the world in which you live.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. No, I don't. But now I am going to try. I am going to see if I can make out who is right, the world or I.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. You are ill, Nora; you are delirious; I almost think you are out of your mind.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. I have never felt my mind so clear and certain as tonight.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. And is it with a clear and certain mind that you forsake your husband and your children?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Yes, it is.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Then there is only one possible explanation.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. What is that?

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. You do not love me anymore.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. No, that is just it.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Nora!--and you can say that?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. It gives me great pain, Torvald, for you have always been so kind to me, but I cannot help it. I do not love you any more.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[regaining his composure]</SPAN>. Is that a clear and certain conviction too?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Yes, absolutely clear and certain. That is the reason why I will not stay here any longer.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. And can you tell me what I have done to forfeit your love?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Yes, indeed I can. It was tonight, when the wonderful thing did not happen; then I saw you were not the man I had thought you were.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Explain yourself better. I don't understand you.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. I have waited so patiently for eight years; for, goodness knows, I knew very well that wonderful things don't happen every day. Then this horrible misfortune came upon me; and then I felt quite certain that the wonderful thing was going to happen at last. When Krogstad's letter was lying out there, never for a moment did I imagine that you would consent to accept this man's conditions. I was so absolutely certain that you would say to him: Publish the thing to the whole world. And when that was done--

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Yes, what then?--when I had exposed my wife to shame and disgrace?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. When that was done, I was so absolutely certain, you would come forward and take everything upon yourself, and say: I am the guilty one.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Nora--!

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. You mean that I would never have accepted such a sacrifice on your part? No, of course not. But what would my assurances have been worth against yours? That was the wonderful thing which I hoped for and feared; and it was to prevent that, that I wanted to kill myself.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. I would gladly work night and day for you, Nora--bear sorrow and want for your sake. But no man would sacrifice his honour for the one he loves.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. It is a thing hundreds of thousands of women have done.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Oh, you think and talk like a heedless child.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Maybe. But you neither think nor talk like the man I could bind myself to. As soon as your fear was over--and it was not fear for what threatened me, but for what might happen to you--when the whole thing was past, as far as you were concerned it was exactly as if nothing at all had happened. Exactly as before, I was your little skylark, your doll, which you would in future treat with doubly gentle care, because it was so brittle and fragile. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Getting up.]</SPAN> Torvald--it was then it dawned upon me that for eight years I had been living here with a strange man, and had borne him three children--. Oh, I can't bear to think of it! I could tear myself into little bits!

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[sadly]</SPAN>. I see, I see. An abyss has opened between us--there is no denying it. But, Nora, would it not be possible to fill it up?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. As I am now, I am no wife for you.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. I have it in me to become a different man.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Perhaps--if your doll is taken away from you.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. But to part!--to part from you! No, no, Nora, I can't understand that idea.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[going out to the right]</SPAN>. That makes it all the more certain that it must be done. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[She comes back with her cloak and hat and a small bag which she puts on a chair by the table.]</SPAN>

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Nora, Nora, not now! Wait until tomorrow.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[putting on her cloak]</SPAN>. I cannot spend the night in a strange man's room.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. But can't we live here like brother and sister--?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[putting on her hat]</SPAN>. You know very well that would not last long. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Puts the shawl round her.]</SPAN> Goodbye, Torvald. I won't see the little ones. I know they are in better hands than mine. As I am now, I can be of no use to them.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. But some day, Nora--some day?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. How can I tell? I have no idea what is going to become of me.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. But you are my wife, whatever becomes of you.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Listen, Torvald. I have heard that when a wife deserts her husband's house, as I am doing now, he is legally freed from all obligations towards her. In any case, I set you free from all your obligations. You are not to feel yourself bound in the slightest way, any more than I shall. There must be perfect freedom on both sides. See, here is your ring back. Give me mine.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. That too?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. That too.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Here it is.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. That's right. Now it is all over. I have put the keys here. The maids know all about everything in the house--better than I do. Tomorrow, after I have left her, Christine will come here and pack up my own things that I brought with me from home. I will have them sent after me.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. All over! All over!--Nora, shall you never think of me again?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. I know I shall often think of you, the children, and this house.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. May I write to you, Nora?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. No--never. You must not do that.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. But at least let me send you--

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Nothing--nothing--

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Let me help you if you are in want.

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. No. I can receive nothing from a stranger.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Nora--can I never be anything more than a stranger to you?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[taking her bag]</SPAN>. Ah, Torvald, the most wonderful thing of all would have to happen.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. Tell me what that would be!

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. Both you and I would have to be so changed that--. Oh, Torvald, I don't believe any longer in wonderful things happening.

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer</SPAN>. But I will believe in it. Tell me! So changed that--?

<P><SPAN class="character">Nora</SPAN>. That our life together would be a real wedlock. Goodbye. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[She goes out through the hall.]</SPAN>

<P><SPAN class="character">Helmer </SPAN><SPAN class="stage-direction">[sinks down on a chair at the door and buries his face in his hands]</SPAN>. Nora! Nora! <SPAN class="stage-direction">[Looks round, and rises.]</SPAN> Empty. She is gone. <SPAN class="stage-direction">[A hope flashes across his mind.]</SPAN> The most wonderful thing of all--?

<P><SPAN class="stage-direction">[The sound of a door shutting is heard from below.]</SPAN>

*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK, A DOLL'S HOUSE ***

This file should be named dlshs11h.htm or dlshs11h.zip
Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks get a new NUMBER, dlshs12h.htm
VERSIONS based on separate sources get new LETTER, dlshs11ah.htm


Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
<a href="http://gutenberg.net">http://gutenberg.net</a> or
<a href="http://promo.net.pg">http://promo.net/pg</a>

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

<a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext04">http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext05</a> or

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here? You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this eBook, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS EBOOK

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market
any commercial products without permission.

To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

receive this eBook from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook) disclaims
all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE

If you discover a Defect in this eBook within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from. If you received it

such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy. If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS EBOOK IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS". NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE EBOOK OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold Michael Hart, the Foundation,
